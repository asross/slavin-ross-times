“This year we are having more difficulty than during the
Korean War,” says Ko Chun Gyu, Anju’s deputy mayor. The
city’s last grain shipment was delivered March 26. Ko has no
idea when the next will arrive. stem

dicator of severe
malnutrition.

Orphanage di-
rector Shi Mae Sun
says she has re-
ceived 40 children
so far this year,
compared with 80
all of last year. Malnutrition, she says, is the main cause of the
maternal deaths and now imperils the children. “We need
food, we need rice,” Shi says.

>In a clinic in Pakchon, just north of Anju, half a dozen
mothers and their babies are crammed into a room that mea-
sures 6 feet by 4. Tak Se Gyong, the clinic director, says diar-
rhea and colitis are common because of the unconventional
diet and contamination of the water supply when the local
pumping station was wrecked by floods. “This winter, 30 ba-
bies have died,” he says, compared with 20 last year.

> In Sinuiju hospital, the staff is struggling to find food for

doctors as well as patients. Kim Jin Shik, the hospital director,
says he can feed patients 450 grams of grain daily until May.
But doctors are getting only 100 grams, which is equivalent to
450 calories and less than a third of the 1,500 calories needed
to maintain the body weight of someone who does no work.

It is difficult to imagine how anyone can work, let alone re-
cover from illness, in the hospital. Like most buildings the dele-
gation visited, it has no heat. The visitors could see their breath
inside the frigid halls despite the spring sunshine outside.
There also are few medicines beyond herbal remedies; there

are no antibiotics.

Shik says deaths in the 800-bed hospital are up 10% to 15%
this year. Old people and children are the main victims. He has
seen a surge in cases of tuberculosis, previously rare. Many
patients complain of intestinal problems. Kim Moon Chul, a
bony 34-year-old, has diarrhea from eating unmilled grain.

It is extremely difficult to generalize about conditions
throughout North Korea on the basis of such a brief visit. But
U.N. relief workers in Pyongyang who have also been allowed
to inspect areas well north of the
capital say the situation is grave.

Runar Soerensen, a Norwegian
who is the local representative for
UNICEF, traveled last week to
Huichon, about 150 miles north of
Pyongyang. “I saw real malnour-
ished children,” Soerensen says of
the industrial town, whose fac-

tories have been shut for lack of electricity and raw materials

and whose nurseries and kindergartens no longer serve meals.
Local authorities told him that of 8,800 children under age 7,
3,400 had stopped growing for lack of nutrients, 750 showed
visible malnutrition and 140 were in “grave danger. You can
easily see when children are at the end of their life,” Soeren-
sen, a doctor, says. “I saw 10 in the hospital who were like
fees and lay corey quiet.”

Tesponse to the crisis, the government agreed last month
to let the U.N. World Food Program, its chief source of interna-
tional aid, feed all 2.5 million children in the country age 6 and
under. Birgitta Karlgren, WFP director for North Korea, says
that her organization has just doubled a worldwide appeal for
grain to 200,000 tons. But even if the United Nations can raise
the necessary funds to pay for that grain, Karlgren says North
Korea needs at least 1.1 million more tons to get by until the

since the North's division from the South at
the end of World War II. 2
Traveling to North Korea is like entering
a time capsule. Pyongyang is a city of wide
avenues but almost no cars; of monumental
Stalinist-style architecture, billboards em-
blazoned with upbeat slogans and giant stat-
ues of Kim II Sung, the country’s dictator un-
til his death in 1994. This week, while their
countrymen outside the capital were
scrounging for weeds, better-fed youngsters
in Pyongyang were practicing gymnastics in
preparation for celebrations marking the
85th anniversary of Kim's birth. i
Exposing scenes of poverty and depriva-
tion to the outside world is obviously painful
for a country that has prided itself for 50
years on a philosophy of self-reliance. De-
spite their obvious need and desire for out-
side help, urbane foreign ministry officials
seemed embarrassed and angry as the visi-
tors snapped pictures of the saddest scenes.
Officials also were uncomfortable when
visitors spotted evidence that North Korea's
strict socialism is being relaxed to enable
people to cope with the government's fail-
ure to feed them. In Sinuiju, a city of 300,000
where state grain distribution centers are
empty, a handful of women were seen run-
ning ‘tiny kiosks where they sold sugar,
homemade buns and batter-dipped crabs.
With the city’s petrochemical factories
shut for lack of fuel and raw materials, Kim
Suk Hyon, a city official, says local workers
are assembling clothing as low-wage subcon-
tractors for the Chinese. f
Standing on the banks of the Yalu River,
across which thousands of Chinese soldiers
poured in 1950 in aid of the North Koreans
during the war, visitors were struck by the

huge @P that has grown between the two
countries since China took the capitalist
road Dearly 20 years ago. On the Korean
side, a few people wandered around a dere-
lict aMUsement park, its rides dingy and ap-

ntly long unused. Across the river, the
Chinese city of Dandong shimmered like a
mirage Of plenty, its high rise buildings spar-
kling iM the early spring sun.

The Crisis presents the government of
North Korea an opportunity, if it will seize it,
to make changes that could help it join
Asia’s ©Conomic boom, or at least avoid be-
ing left further behind.

Clearly, the government of Kim Jong Il,
the son of Kim II Sung, has decided to seek
closet relations with the United States. Prod-
ded by the sheer enormity of the food crisis,
the North is contemplating actions that
would have been anathema only a few years
ago. AS early as next Week, the North is ex-
pected to agree to formal peace talks that
will finally end the Korean War. since the
fighting ended in 1953, the North has ob-
served a cease-fire but has never acknowl-
edged the end of the war. The North is also
taking part in talks about recovering re-
mains of Americans still missing in action
from the war and about North Korea's mis-
sile sales to countries such as Libya.

These openings, however tentative, are a
difficult adjustment for a people raised to
regard the United States as an aggressor and
sponsor of a hostile South Korea.

“The Americans started the war in Ko-
rea,” says Kim Gyong Il, a patient at Sinuiju
hospital, repeating the propaganda North
Koreans have been taught. But Kim also ex-
presses pleasure at meeting his first U'S. citi-
zen: “If you help with our food troubles, you

will be most welcome,” he says. |
