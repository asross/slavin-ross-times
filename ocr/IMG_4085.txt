FROM OUR CAIRO CORRESPONDENT

UESTIONABLE mental stability
and overweening geopolitical ambi-
tion are qualities that his critics

attribute to Colonel Moammar Qaddafi.
Be that as it may, he has been prudently
reducing Libya’s targets. He may be lim-
bering up for fresh battles in Chad to the
south, yet the colonel has been unusually
conciliatory towards his North African
neighbours, including Egypt, the Arab
country he has loved and hated the most.

On March 28th he rounded off a
month of reciprocal gestures by announc-
ing that he was withdrawing Libyan
troops from the border with Egypt. Ear-

lier Egypt had released four Libyan MIG-23-

fighter aircraft which, on March Ist,
landed in a sand-storm in Egypt’s western
desert. On March 24th Libya repatriated
36 Egyptian political prisoners long held
in Libya, including some alleged spies;
and Egypt sent back five Libyan air force
| people who arrived in Egypt inadver-
| tently last year, when their superior ofh-
| cers defected in Libyan aircraft. The Liby-
ans are looking at financial claims from
_ the Egyptians who were among the thou-
| sands of guest-workers sent home in
1985: similar claims by Tunisian workers
were sorted out last autumn.
Saudi Arabia has been pressing Egypt
ad other Arab nations to be nicer to
Qaddafi, for fear he might slide
nian side in the Gulf war.

drew the line at exchanging ambassadors
with Egypt. Other Arab governments
have chosen to overlook Egypt’s peace
treaty with Israel; the colonel still says it is
“treason” to the Arab cause, but has
promised no longer to oppose it by force.

Egypt reckons that the Libyans have
40,000 troops, more than half their army,
in the eastern military zone they have
now pledged to abolish. The two coun-
tries fought a brief border war in 1977.
Yet Libya’s army, a fifth the size of
Egypt’s, poses no conventional military
threat. Egyptian scepticism about the new
gestures of friendship stem rather from

the frequent bombings, hijackings and
assassination attempts carried out by Lib-
yan mercenaries since Egypt rebuffed Lib-
ya’s call for a merger 16 years ago.

The Egyptians are much more con-
cerned about the Libyan threat to their
bankrupt and misgoverned southern
neighbour, Sudan. Egypt thinks Libya
employs about 2,000 mercenaries in the
Darfur region, organised as an ‘‘Islamic
Legion” under Libyan officers pretending
to be farm specialists. This force confuses
Sudan’s civil war. It could also mount a
diversionary raid into Chad.

Last year Chad’s bold but lightly
armed soldiers knocked out about a tenth
of the Libyan army which, since then, has
observed six months of ceasefire on the
Chad front. In May the Organisation of
African Unity is due to produce its at-
tempt to resolve the dispute over the
Aozou Strip, which the Libyans claim to
have annexed from Chad 15 years ago.
But the Libyans have been extending
their airstrips there: Egyptian offcials
doubt that Colonel Qaddafi will get out
of the Aozou, even if told to do so. The
Chadians, with new Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles from the Americans, are keen to
have another fight.

Belatedly, Colonel Qaddafi is paying
attention to the demoralised home front.
In March he freed several hundred pris-
oners after bulldozing a Tripoli jail (130
foreigners, one of them British, were also
freed). He also gave back the passports of
some Libyans who had been banned from
travelling. “Libya is the land of freedom,”
he declared. Maybe he is not such a realist

after all.
