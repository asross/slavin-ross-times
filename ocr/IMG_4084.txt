TRIPOLI, Libya — The back of what used to be the French Embassy in Tripoli is still missing its windows. Rusty metal rods protrude from the crumbling side of a villa next door, chunks of concrete hanging from some of them like rotten fruit.

Nearly three years after the United States and Libya last came to blows, the wounds of that confrontation are still glaringly and deliberately apparent in Bin Ashur, an upper-middle class neighborhood accidentally hit when the United States bombed Tripoli in the middle of the night of April 15, 1986.

“I guess the government wants the people to remember,” said Abdul Razak Tonnelli, an 18-year-old student who lives across the street from the ruins. “Now the Americans may hit again,” he said. “It’s a big problem.”

Some Libyans, remembering the night the U.S. F-111s roared in from the sea to avenge Libyan involvement in a terrorist bombing in Berlin, have left the capital for second homes in the countryside or to visit relatives in other cities.

The Bab al-Aziziya barracks of Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, where the wreckage of.
his residence, purposely hit in 1986, also remains unrepaired, has reportedly been further fortified in case the Americans try again to kill the Libyan leader.

Reporters touring the city Friday saw extra troops posted around the barracks and warplanes on alert on a side runway of Tripoli’s international airport. Gadhafi himself has kept out of public view since Wednesday.

But the mood in the seaside capital, while hardly cheery, was far from panicked. Tripoli was not deserted and its inhabitants, compared to the lead-up with to 1986 bombing, seemed comparatively relaxed.

“There's some underlying tension but nothing like 1986,” said a European diplomat. “Security forces have been put on alert, and some
reserves were called back to the barracks.”

On Friday, the weekly holiday in Moslem
countries, young men lounged at snack bars
tucked into peeling Italianate
buildings along the colonnaded boulevards built here by Libya’s former colonial rulers. Some of them were reading the latest issue of the major government daily,
<em>Al Jamahiriya</em>, which ran a front-page cartoon showing President Reagan with a bomb in his hand.

Just off the city’s central Green Square, where Gadhafi likes to address his people, a flea market he allowed to open six months ago was crowded with Libyans and East Europeans and Filipino migrant workers.

“No, I’m not frightened,” said a Moroccan peddler who was selling Turkish blue jeans for
$30 a pair. ‘Besides, business is too good.”

Should the United States attack, the presumed target this time would not be Tripoli itself, but a factory at the desert town of Rabta 40 miles south of the city that Washington says is potentially the biggest producer of chemical
weapons in the Third World.

The Libyans deny this and say the plant is in
fact intended to produce medicine. Libyan doctors and nurses and members of the local “Peoples Congress” have been sitting in at the factory, according to the Libyan news agency, JANA, to protest the American threat to destroy the plant.

To bolster its claims that the plant is harmless, Libya promised to show the facility to foreign journalists who descended on Tripoli over the past three days.

But instead of the plant at Rabta, two busloads of reporters, who were not told their destination until they had traveled more than an hour from Tripoli, were taken to the Roman ruins at Leptis Magna for a bit of sightseeing. 
They were kept out of the capital until after dark.

Appearing later before a crowd of angry reporters in Tripoli’s Grand Hotel, Libyan Information Minister Rajad Abu Dabous promised a tour of the plant today.


“We are innocent. It is a pharmaceutical
plant and nothing more,’ he said. He added,
however, that “nothing in international law
prevents a country from setting up a plant to
produce whatever it wants.”


As in past confrontations, the Libyans are portraying themselves as the victims of American aggression following the loss of two of their
warplanes in a dogfight Wednesday over the
Mediterranean.

But while Gadhafi has vowed to “meet
challenge with challenge,” his government has
sought to keep the conflict from escalating.

Instead of threatening to send “suicide squads” to assassinate Americans, as the Libyans did in 1986, they have appealed for diplomatic support from fellow Arabs and at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council.

There has not been a public funeral for the two pilots the Libyans have privately admitted were killed in Wednesday’s dogfight.

“The Libyans are genuinely afraid that the
Americans are going to go after wider targets,
and they want to defuse the situation,” the
European diplomat said. The diplomat, who
attributed the dogfight to carelessness or bravado on the part of the Libyan pilots, noted that Gadhafi has tried hard in the past year to repair his image as a reckless adventurer.

“He’s being careful not to damage his image again,” the diplomat said.

In Bin Ashur, however, it is the U.S. image
that seems to need repairing. The student,
standing on a weedy knoll covering what had
been a bomb crater, said the Untied States was
not really interested in destroying the chemical factory but really wanted instead “to hit the
Libyan government.”

Asked why the United States would want to do this, he said, “because they are imperialists.”
