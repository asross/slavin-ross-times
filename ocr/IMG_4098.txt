Ham radio operator Joe Santangelo, with his basement rig in Reading, Mass., sayS his hobby is also a
public service. “When everything goes out, hams provide the communication.”

public service aspects, particularly its ability to
relay information in an emergency when land
lines fail. “When everything goes out, hams pro-
vide the communication,” he says. At 76 a young-
ster in the group but technologically the. most ad-
vanced, Santangelo built the net around him in
the 1960s and ’70s by running phone patches for
radio amateurs with relatives in the Boston area,
particularly hams with children attending colleges
in the region.

As the kids graduated, the parents kept talking,
bolstering each other through job changes, ill-
nesses, retirements and moves around the coun-

Natural forces other than radio waves have be-
gun to take their toll. Last year, George
(WA4RPU) from Norfolk moved to a heavenly
frequency; Ernie (K3WMM) in Baltimore just
went into a nursing home.

These days, Dad and Grodzinsky are as apt to
compare retirement communities as radio equip-
ment. Although they've met in person only a few
times, they and their wives know and like each
other so well after so many years of meeting “on
the air” that they are thinking of moving to the

same place.

t’s impossible for me to conceive of my fa-
ther without amateur radio.

Although by profession he was a pharma-
cist and systems analyst for the Food and
Drug Administration, his true calling has al-

ways been amateur radio. He’s been a ham for
more than 60 of his 78 years.

A New York City boy, he caught the radio bug
in 1929 at age 12 when, for the then-princely sum
of $1, he bought a failed science project from a
fellow student and, after three months, got the
project—a one-tube receiver—to work.

“I collected stamps. I did chemistry experi-
ments. I built model airplanes. But when I built
this first radio, I got so fascinated with it that I
dropped all the other hobbies,” he says.

In 1935, convalescing from an illness that
knocked him out of the City College of New York
for six weeks, he studied for and got his ham li-
cense. From then on, he was on the air, as W2IZX
until 1961, when we moved to California and he
had to change his call letters.

The crackle and squawk of radio voices was the
background music of my childhood, and the curi-
ous lingo of hams was my first foreign language.

“CQ, CQ the frequency [calling anyone},” Dad
would say, ensconced in his ham shack, which al-
ways occupied the place of honor in our den.
“This is K3 Fat Good Boy, calling and listening.”

Upon achieving a contact, or QSO, he would
give his handle (“Mexico Ocean Radio Texas”), his
QTH (location) and his rig (equipment). If the
QRM (interference) wasn’t too bad, he would talk
about his work, his war experiences in the Navy
and his family—the “junior op” (my brother), the

“YL” (young lady, i.e., me) and the “XYL” (former
young lady, my mom). At the end of the contact,
it was “73s,” or regards, and on to the next QSO.
According to the ARRL’s Newkirk, a lot of ham
talk is descended from the slang and abbrevia-
tions used by railroad telegraph punchers, the
pool from which the first radio operators were
drawn at the turn of the century. :
The term “ham?” itself was apparently a pejora-
tive that once meant a telegrapher wet behind the

earphones. Newkirk explains: In the days before
radio amateurs were confined to certain frequen-

cies, commercial operators would sometimes
complain, “those hams are jamming you.”

I always thought radio amateurs were called
hams because they loved to hear themselves talk
and because they were so proud of their ability,
particularly in the days before solid state elec-
tronics, to build so much of their own equipment.

Ican still remember the acrid smell of solder as
Dad put together receivers and transmitters in
the basement, choosing parts from boxes of color-
fully banded resistors, capacitors and tubes.

On trips to see my mother’s parents in Brook-
lyn, Dad and I would escape to “Radio Row’ in
lower Manhattan, a tinkerers’ paradise of dis-
count electronic surplus stores that, unfortunate-
ly, was swept away to make room for the World
Trade Center.

Although radio was never Dad's profession,
hams were instrumental in his career. A fellow
ham put him on a Veterans Administration auto-
mation team that got him a transfer from a VA
hospital in East Orange, NJ., to study systems
analysis in Santa Monica, Calif.

Eventually, he wound up at the FDA and we
moved to Bethesda, where the antenna Dad
erected in the back yard led one boyfriend of mine
to. dub out’ modest brick rambler “the NATO -
base.”

When my mother, who worked for the Public
Health Service, contracted a chronic illness, the
net Dad had joined when I went off to college kept
his spirits up. In the late 1970s, both my parents
retired from government and moved to Florida
for a time, The net stayed with them and even
gained a few Florida converts,

Eventually, most of the members met face-to-
face on road trips up and down the East Coast to
visit children and grandchildren.

Nowadays, they get together on one of two fre-
quencies in the 40 meter band (7190 or 7215) ev-
ery morning at 7:30 and sometimes again at
noon.

“It’s provided a source of relaxation. It helped
me through those early years when your mother
was very sick and it’s been a source of social con-
tact as we've moved around the country,” Dad -
says. “T have no other friends but the guys on the
air.”
