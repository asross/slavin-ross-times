WASHINGTON &mdash; Even Henry Kissinger, who fixed Middle
Eastern truces in the days before Arabs
and Israelis would lift a telephone to each
other, dabbed his eyes. True, Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel’s prime minister, declined to put his
signature on the same bit of paper as Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, leaving that to his foreign
minister, Shimon Peres, and Mahmoud
Abbas, Mr Arafat’s number three. True too,
Mr Rabin had to be coaxed by Bill Clinton
into shaking Mr Arafat’s hand. No matter,
the sun shone on the White House lawn on
September 13th, the deal was made and ev-
erybody was deeply moved. As they were
right to be.

The Americans, who had little to do with
the negotiations that led up to the agree-
ment, redeemed themselves as the perfect
stage-managers for its public celebration.
Mr Clinton, the youngest man on the po-
dium, projected an avuncular air, congratu-
lating the children for making up their
quarrel. He delivered an eloquent speech
that quoted from the Bible and the Koran,
wove in his trademark themes of change
and optimism and promised active Ameri-
can support in the days ahead.

A big element in this support is reassur-
ing sceptical Israelis—and worried Ameri-
can Jews—that Israel’s agreement to with-
draw from Gaza and Jericho, and allow a
degree of Palestinian self-rule in much of
the rest of the West Bank, will not jeopardise
Israel’s security. In his speech and at inter-
views, the president reiterated that this secu-
rity is still a paramount American concern.
He strongly implied that Israel will con-
tinue to get its annual $3 billion (more than
a quarter of America’s bilateral foreign-aid)
despite budget concerns. Administration
officials have also indicated that they would
look favourably on Israeli requests for yet
more sophisticated weaponry.

The administration’s cosy relationship
with Israel appears to have been one of the
reasons for the PLO’s decision to bypass the
official talks in Washington and negotiate
with the Israelis in secret in Norway. Once
there, they found that Mr Rabin’s govern-
ment was prepared to be more forthcoming
than allowed for in the “compromise”
drafts put out by the State Department.

The Jordanians, however, were happy to
stay in Washington for their own negotia-
tions. A framework for an Israel-Jordan
peace treaty, essentially completed a year
ago but held up by Jordan until the break-
through with the PLO, was signed at the
State Department on September 14th. Mr
Clinton rewarded King Hussein with a
promise of economic aid.

The Syrians, too, are sticking with the
Americans. Warren Christopher, the secre-
tary of state, has offered to fly again to the
region after the Israelis have had a chance to
digest Palestinian developments. Another
possibility is that Mr Peres will get together
with Farouk Sharaa, his Syrian counterpart,
when the United Nations General Assem-
bly opens shortly in New York.

The UN was the site of Mr Arafat’s only
other visit to the United States, in 1974,
when he appeared before the General As-
sembly with a gun on his hip; after that he
was barred from entry. This time, he put his
security in the hands of the American Secret
Service, and the man whom most Ameri-
cans have for decades loved to hate, fear and
deride was suddenly the star of Washing-
ton. The swiftness with which diplomatic
taboos tumbled, and the enthusiasm with
which he was greeted by the political estab-
lishment, were remarkable even by the stan-
dards of this power-hungry city.

It used to be thought that it would be
America that would persuade Israel to ac-
cept the PLO. In fact it was the other way
about. So far America has only resumed the
“dialogue” begun in 1988 and broken off in
1990; Palestinian interests are represented
in Washington by a Palestine Affairs Centre
staffed by American residents. But here was
Mr Arafat being received at the White
House—where he held an unscheduled téte-a-téte with Mr Clinton in the basement map
room—and then passing on to the State De-
partment, Congress and “Larry King Live”.
Asked at a National Press Club lunch when
he expected that the United States would
formally recognise the PLO, Mr Arafat re-
plied: “We have already achieved it.”

In his first foray into American public
relations, Mr Arafat was an undeniable hit,
especially on Capitol Hill, where he spent
the day after the ceremony working the lead-
ership of the Senate and House of Represen-
tatives like a practised western politician.
The House Speaker, Tom Foley, pro-
nounced him “a very engaging personal-
ity”. The Senate majority leader, George
Mitchell, said he was looking into the laws
that prohibit dealings with the PLO, so that
they could be changed.

America’s financial contribution to Pal-
estinian development is certain to be mea-
sured only in millions, not the billions
doled out to Israel and Egypt ever since they
signed their peace treaty in 1979. But Wash-
ington will help to solicit contributions
from Europe, Japan and wealthy Arabs.

On the evening of the signing ceremony, the American Jewish Congress and the National Association of Arab Americans cosponsored a reception at which Arabs and Jews chatted over the buffet tables and listened to Hebrew and Arabic folksongs.
They were told by Nabil Shaath, an American-educated businessman who has long been an adviser to Mr Arafat, that they had the choice of making the new Palestinian entity either a Singapore or a Somalia.

The first alternative is, of course, nonsense: there are still miles to go, even if local die-hards do not sabotage the effort, before Mr Arafat’s new sub-state escapes the living standards of the third world. But at least some Jewish Americans, who have supported Israel through thick and thin, are beginning to see the reasons for supporting its ex-enemies as well.
