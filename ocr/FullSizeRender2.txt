from Europe, Japan and wealthy Arabs.

On the evening of the signing ceremony, the American Jewish Congress and the National Association of Arab Americans cosponsored a reception at which Arabs and Jews chatted over the buffet tables and listened to Hebrew and Arabic folksongs.
They were told by Nabil Shaath, an American-educated businessman who has long been an adviser to Mr Arafat, that they had the choice of making the new Palestinian entity either a Singapore or a Somalia.

The first alternative is, of course, nonsense: there are still miles to go, even if local die-hards do not sabotage the effort, before Mr Arafatâ€™s new sub-state escapes the living standards of the third world. But at least some Jewish Americans, who have supported Israel through thick and thin, are beginning to see the reasons for supporting its ex-enemies as well.
