TRIPOLI, Libya — The music was rock ’n’ roll,
but the lyrics were vintage Moammar Khadafy.

“To satisfy needs fully indeed is a big duty and a
great deed,” crooned the young woman on televi-
sion. Let’s strive, she sang, “to help cut imports to a
minimum and raise production to a maximum.”

Slogans are everywhere in Col. Khadafy’s Libya.
Television programs are interrupted frequently to
flash sayings on the screen from his “green book” —
a three-part treatise expounding a revolutionary
world view that is part Mao, part Marx and part
gobbledygook. Even Libyan airline tickets carry
slogans — “Popular Committees Everywhere” —
neatly printed on the front in green.

For a foreign visitor, Khadafy’s ideology seems
more ludicrous than lethal, more Marx Brothers
than Marx. But for the 3.5-million people of Libya,
it is no laughing matter, especially in a time of
economic crisis.

While revenues from oil, the country’s only
source of foreign exchange, have plummeted from
$22-billion in 1980 to $8-billion last year, Khadafy
has kept up domestic military spending and sup-
port for revolutionary movements worldwide. Liby-
an consumers have had to bear the brunt of cut-
backs in imports from a budgeted $5-billion last
year to at most $1.8-billion according to diplomats
and businessmen in Tripoli. The result is that in
North Africa’s richest nation, residents must stand
in line for hours to buy bread and meat.

Khadafy’s inspiration in foreign policy comes
from Gamel Abdel Nasser, the late Egyptian leader
who promoted Arab unity and Third World non-
alignment. In domestic policy, his model appears to
be China’s late leader, Mao Tse-tung. Khadafy’s

“Green Book” is an obvious copy of Mao’s Red
Book, China’s bible during the 1965-1975 Cultural
Revolution.

Like Mao, a man of peasant origin, Khadafy
seems to have an innate distrust of the educated
bureaucrats that make government work. For the
past two years and especially in the last year,
diplomats and businessmen here say, he has been
accelerating a Maoist experiment in continuing
upheaval, reducing the number and power of bu-
reaucrats and infiltrating Libyan institutions with
members of so-called revolutionary committees.

Early last month, the General People’s Con-
gress, the nominal Parliament, eliminated half the
government’s 20 ministries, including oil, justice
social security, agriculture and information, and

shifted their duties to remaining ministries
other bodies, og

Surviving ministers were also reshuffled. As
of his first acts, the new education minister, Ahmed
Ibrahim, a man in his 30s with a degree in Khadafy’s
Green Book philosophy, closed down the English
and French departments at Tripoli’s Fateh Univer-
sity. ;

occasion by burning a heap of foreign language
books. The committee members, who wear no insig-
nia, also led anti-American demonstrations last
month and burned the houses of “stray dogs” —
Libyans who have left the country to live abroad.

Khadafy’s commitment to continual agitation is
in part motivated by genuine idealism, in part by
cold political calculation, foreign analysts here say.

“The basis of Khadafy’s power is to create
disorganization,” said a European diplomat, noting
that the country’s 75,000-member armed forces —
the most organized institution in the country and
thus, the biggest potential threat to Khadafy — has
also been thoroughly infiltrated with revolutionary
committees.

In theory, Libya has already reached the Utopia

of the withering away of state power. In 1977, the
general people’s congress proclaimed rule by the
people and. changed Libya’s name to the Socialist
People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, a term roughly
translated as “gathering of the masses.” In 1980,
Khadafy himself resigned all formal office and now
goes by the title “Leader of the Revolution.”

Decision-making power is nominally vested in
1,400 people’s congresses, local councils that send
representatives to the General People’s Congress.
How representatives are selected is something of a
mystery, since Khadafy has abolished elections as a
capitalist invention that is inherently corrupt and
automatically favors the rich. But one can be sure
that no known critic of Khadafy stands any chance
of being chosen.

The General People’s Congress is theoretically
supreme. But according to foreign analysts here,
power over all important decisions still rests with
Khadafy, his longtime No. 2 man, Maj. Abdul
Salaam Jalloud, and to a lesser extent three other
surviving officers among 12 who overthrew Libya’s
monarchy in 1969.

“Of course the whole thing is a big bluff,” said a
Western businessman who travels frequently to
Libya. “During debates on important topics at the
people’s congresses, Khadafy will be interviewed on
TV and asked what his ideas are. He'll say some-
thing ee a eae ie not for me to say but it

One saving grace of the system has been that
some of its more disruptive decisions have been
ignored, amended or rescinded. After protests by

ister backed down and agreed to apply the new

on grounds that Libyans could better teach their

children at home, but were reopened three weeks €.
later. The expulsion last fall of nearly a quarter of fd
Libya’s half-million foreign workers was a People’sim
Congress decision that was not put into effect for
two years.

“In the past, bureaucrats could get away with
ignoring the GPC (General People’s Congress),
said a senior diplomat from a non-aligned country.
“Municipal chiefs used to take decision on most
matters because their budget was given to them
Now as the money becomes scarcer, their decision-
making powers are being reduced. I have been told
that the People’s Congress is going to play a more
important role in the future.”

No open political dissent is tolerated in Libya.
The only Libyans who seem to get away with
criticism are unsophisticated peasants. A Western
businessman said he and his Libyan acquaintances
have been amused and startled to hear peasant
members of the GPC “suddenly say things that if
educated people had said them, they would lose!
their necks.” For example, he said, during a recent
debate on whether Libyans who fled abroad should!
be hunted down and killed, a peasant stood up and)
said, “No, don’t kill them. They shared the good)
economic times with us and now we should force)
them to come back to Libya and have the dirty end)
of the stick.” |

When no one else is listening, Tripoli residents
grumble about Khadafy. One shopkeeper said
youngsters attend anti-American rallies “only be-
cause they are ordered to,” a comment borne out by
the apathy of demonstrators at rallies during the
Gulf of Sidra crisis with the United States. ‘e

But if many Libyans are fed up with Khadafy,
foreign analysts here say they are not about to rise
