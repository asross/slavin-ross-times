For the one person out of five on earth
who is a Chinese peasant, life could only
get better after Chairman Mao’s time;
and it has. (China’s new census says that
there are 1.008 billion Chinese of whom
four fifths are peasants.) Some of the
improvements have been dramatic. En-

couraged by higher prices for their pro-
ducts and by what amounts to an aban-
donment of collective farming, Chinese
peasants have doubled their incomes in
five years (to $130 a head) and boosted
the living standards of the nation. Chi-
nese newspapers are full of self-congratu-
latory articles about the record harvest
expected this year.

China has become a land of relative
plenty as a result of the decision to “first
feed the people, second build the coun-
try’, as Mr Hu Yaobang, the party’s
secretary-general, put it at last month’s
party congress. The prices the state pays
for agricultural goods were raised by
25%. Three years ago peasants were
encouraged to cultivate private plots, and
the size of these plots was doubled. Then,
in 1980, production teams, consisting of a
few dozen families, were given responsi-
bility for deciding what to plant and how
to allocate the surplus.

Under this so-called “responsibility
system”, which has a counterpart in in-
dustry, the more a peasant produces, the
more he earns. At first, only poorer
regions were allowed to devolve responsi-
bility for decision-making and profit-tak-
ing down from the team to individual

farm families. But now the “household
responsibility system’’ has spread to 45%
of China’s production teams. It is not
quite private farming, since nobody owns
his land, but it is near enough to give
peasants a big new incentive to work.
The trouble is that the incentive system
is not without costs. It has tempted profit-
seeking farmers to shift land out of grain
and into cash crops such as cotton and
tobacco. The government has had to
offer new incentives—access to ferti-
lisers, farm tools, even bicycles—to stop
peasants reducing cereal acreage. Farm-

ers tend to use less fertiliser because it
costs so much. Seeing the new value of
extra manpower, families are ignoring
the one-child norm of the family planners
and keeping their sons away from army
recruiters. And, fearing a return to “eat-
ing out of a big pot”, peasants are reluc-
tant to look beyond the next harvest.

A radio broadcast in Guangxi province
recently noted that peasants were “‘will-
ing to do only things that benefit them in
the short term and do not want to under-
take projects from which they will benefit
after several years”. Peasants also fear
that prices and profit margins may be cut.
The government has announced that
there will be no increase in the prices of
farm commodities for the next few years.
The press has been complaining about
the high cost of subsidies on food. Some
observers think that subsidies will be cut
but one noted that “Chinese farmers

From rags to riches in Dazhai

FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Dazhai, in the Taihang mountains in
northern China, was Chairman Mao’s
favourite commune. Its peasants were
praised for putting party before personal
profit, for disdaining private plots in
favour of communal labour. Other Chi-
nese were constantly pressed to “learn
from Dazhai”. Thousands of visitors to
China were taken to this showpiece of
communism.

When Mao died, Dazhai was revealed
to have been “a fabrication, an exagger-
ation, confected by self-aggrandising lo-
cal and national leaders”. The son of the
commune leader Chen Yonggui was ex-
posed as a rapist and blackmailer. Chen

himself, who had made it to the politbu- .

TO, was accused of misusing his power.

Little more was heard of the disgraced
commune until September when the

' Shanxi Daily, Dazhai’s local paper, said

that Dazhai had gone over to Mr Deng
Xiaoping’s ‘‘responsibility system’,
which allows peasants to keep some of
their produce for private sale at the best
price they can obtain.

The slogan ‘‘Learn from Dazhai”’ has.
almost vanished from China’s walls, ei-
ther painted over, chipped off, or
bleached into a ghostly reminder. The
commune once famed for its austerity is
now being publicised’as a place where
1,068 families “make their fortunes by
hard work’. Not for the first time,
Chinese _peasants are learning that
adaptability is a quality to be cultivated.
