For the one person out of five on earth
who is a Chinese peasant, life could only
get better after Chairman Mao’s time;
and it has. (China’s new census says that
there are 1.008 billion Chinese of whom
four fifths are peasants.) Some of the
improvements have been dramatic. Encouraged by higher prices for their products and by what amounts to an abandonment of collective farming, Chinese
peasants have doubled their incomes in
five years (to $130 a head) and boosted
the living standards of the nation. Chinese newspapers are full of self-congratulatory articles about the record harvest
expected this year.

China has become a land of relative plenty as a result of the decision to “first
feed the people, second build the country’, as Mr Hu Yaobang, the party’s
secretary-general, put it at last month’s
party congress. The prices the state pays
for agricultural goods were raised by
25%. Three years ago peasants were
encouraged to cultivate private plots, and
the size of these plots was doubled. Then,
in 1980, production teams, consisting of a
few dozen families, were given responsi-
bility for deciding what to plant and how
to allocate the surplus.

Under this so-called “responsibility
system”, which has a counterpart in industry, the more a peasant produces, the
more he earns. At first, only poorer
regions were allowed to devolve responsi-
bility for decision-making and profit-tak-
ing down from the team to individual
farm families. But now the “household
responsibility system’’ has spread to 45%
of China’s production teams. It is not
quite private farming, since nobody owns
his land, but it is near enough to give
peasants a big new incentive to work.

The trouble is that the incentive system
is not without costs. It has tempted profit-
seeking farmers to shift land out of grain
and into cash crops such as cotton and
tobacco. The government has had to
offer new incentives—access to fertilisers, farm tools, even bicycles—to stop
peasants reducing cereal acreage. Farmers tend to use less fertiliser because it
costs so much. Seeing the new value of
extra manpower, families are ignoring
the one-child norm of the family planners
and keeping their sons away from army
recruiters. And, fearing a return to “eat-
ing out of a big pot”, peasants are reluc-
tant to look beyond the next harvest.

A radio broadcast in Guangxi province
recently noted that peasants were “will-
ing to do only things that benefit them in
the short term and do not want to under-
take projects from which they will benefit
after several years”. Peasants also fear
that prices and profit margins may be cut.
The government has announced that
there will be no increase in the prices of
farm commodities for the next few years.
The press has been complaining about
the high cost of subsidies on food. Some
observers think that subsidies will be cut
but one noted that “Chinese farmers
have always taken it in the neck and are
just worrying that it will happen again”.

Rural party officials who have been
stripped of their power over production
decisions frequently try to sabotage the
responsibility system. In ome case of
spiteful over-zealousness Officials in An-
hui province arrested Wang Quanjing,
whose six-member household had earned
3,000 yuan ($1,500) last.year, mostly by
producing baskets, tea, herbal medicines
and bamboo. Mr Wang’s supposed crime,
besides making so much money, was
hiring people outside his family to help
him to do it. This is now legal but still
unusual. A local radio noted that since
the employees had all volunteered to
work and been paid for it, “such a
practice cannot be looked upon as exploi-
tation”. Still, it took the intervention of a
county party official before Mr Wang was
released.

Inequalities—between families and be-
tween regions—are bound to increase so
long as China allows farmers to demon-
strate differences of intelligence, appli-
cation and luck. The resentment this
leads to should be containable so long as
the profits are coming in. The worry is
that Chinese agriculture may be entering
a period of diminishing returns. Output
has risen by nearly a third since 1977. But
this year it will go up by only 4%, even if
the harvest tops the 1979 record of 337m
tonnes of grain. Experts say the rate of
increase will continue to decline because
all the easy gains have already been
made. Chinese farmers may be right to
grab a quick yuan while they can.
