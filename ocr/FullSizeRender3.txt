Rural party officials who have been
stripped of their power over production
decisions frequently try to sabotage the
responsibility system. In ome case of
spiteful over-zealousness Officials in An-
hui province arrested Wang Quanjing,
whose six-member household had earned
3,000 yuan ($1,500) last.year, mostly by
producing baskets, tea, herbal medicines
and bamboo. Mr Wang’s supposed crime, -
besides making so much money, was
hiring people outside his family to help
him to do it. This is now legal but still
unusual. A local radio noted that since
the employees had all volunteered to
work and been paid for it, “such a -
practice cannot be looked upon as exploi-
tation”. Still, it took the intervention of a
county party official before Mr Wang was
released. eo
Inequalities—between families and be-
tween regions—are bound to increase so
long as China allows farmers to demon-
strate differences of intelligence, appli-
cation and luck. The resentment this
leads to should be containable so long as
the profits are coming in. The worry is
that Chinese agriculture may be entering
a period of diminishing returns. Output
has risen by nearly a third since 1977. But
this year it will go up by only 4%, even if
the harvest tops the 1979 record of 337m
tonnes of grain. Experts say the rate of
increase will continue to decline because
all the easy gains have already been
made. Chinese farmers may be right to
grab a quick yuan while they can.
