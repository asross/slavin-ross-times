FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN BAGHDAD

G6TTOHE end of the war is the start of Sad-

dam's problems.” So said a western
diplomat last year, when the Iranians were
still on the offensive. The conventional wis-
dom used to be that President Saddam Hus-
sein was safe while the war lasted, because to
remove him would be a capitulation to the
Iranians. Now the war is ending, yet there is
still no squeak of a challenge to the regime.

One reason is that the war has drawn to
its close in a better way than most Iraqis
dared hope, with something approximating
to an Iraqi military triumph. That will give
President Hussein a protecting halo of suc-
cess. If he resists the temptation to fight on,
he can now begin to address some of the
pent-up grievances of Iraq’s middle class,
such as a ban on foreign travel: The poor are
likely to be rewarded, too, with a renewed
effort to build hospitals and schools and re-
place mud-brick villages with cities of pre-
fabricated concrete.

In many ways, Iraq has emerged from
this war strengthened, and not only because
its armed forces are bigger and battle-hard-
ened. The exigencies of war forced President
Hussein to ditch some of the more unwork-
able notions of the Baath socialist ideology
which his government officially propounds.
The bureaucracy has been streamlined, and
the private sector has been allowed to play a
bigger part in the economy. The old Baath
dream of Arab unity has been pushed aside
by the fighting to make way for Iraqi nation-
building. The country that used to be derid-
ed as a geographical expression’ has devel-
oped a powerful sense of cohesion.

Even so, the peace holds dangers. Some
relatives of the 300,000 or so Iraqis killed at
the front will question whether an eight-year
war that changed no borders was worth
fighting. Demobilised soldiers who have
faced death in battle will be less easy to in-
timidate than docile civilians. Generals who
earned laurels in the field may bring political
ambitions home to Baghdad. Above all, Iraq
will remain a complicated agglomeration of
different ethnic and religious groupings,
with a long history of fighting each other.

President Hussein and most of his close
friends are Sunni Muslims in a country
where Shias are the majority. At one time

Iran hoped the Shias would throw in their
lot with its own Shia-inspired revolution.
Thar, as it rurned out, was a hopeless dream.
The Iraqi Shias are proud Arabs with no
love of invading Persians, and President
Hussein has worked hard to give them a
fairer deal. In Basra, Iraq’s predominantly
Shia port-city that was much threatened but
never fell, four years of Iranian shelling elim-
inated any affection local residents might
have had for the regime in Tehran.

Still, peace could reopen Iraq’s confes-
sional rifts. During the war, many Iraqis de-
cided that they were Arabs first, Shias sec-
ond. When it is over they may decide to
become Shias first. The end of the fighting is
also liable to lead to a bloody settling of ac-
counts with the one in five Iraqis who are
non-Arab Kurds. When the war was on they
enlisted Iranian help in their struggle for au-
tonomy for their northern region. In return,
hundreds of their villages have been razed
and as many as half a million of them moved
elsewhere, many to bleak desert lands near
the border with Saudi Arabia. Peace holds
little promise for them.

Optimists say that Presidenc Hussein
has mellowed with time. But he seems no
less ruthless now than when he launched his

political career by planting a bomb on a mul-

r Bo Loe Se tak

lah in an effort to kill a Kurdish guerrilla. Ac
present his power is absolute: in his pres
ence, it is said, colleagues sit trembling on
their seats. Top jobs go to friends and rela-
tives from Takrit, the president's home
town in the north. The two most powerful
men after him are said to be the defence
minister, Mr Adnan Khairallah (a cousin),
and the industry minister, Brigadier-Gener-
al Hussein Kamil (a son-in-law).

Economic reconstruction should be fast
in Iraq, despite its $60 billion debt. Last year
President Hussein launched an efficiency
drive that swept away one of the layers of
bureaucracy that smothered state compa-
nies. Productivity is said to have climbed
since the private sector was given more free-
dom. The privatisation of small state-owned
assets such as vegetable markets and poultry
farms has also helped relieve scarcities (al-
though there was no butter or Pepsi-Cola in
Baghdad or Basra last week).

But prices have risen too. The govern-
ment’s habit of paying for the war by print-
ing money has slashed the black-market val- .
ue of the Iraqi dinar from $3.20 before the
war to 40 cents. Salaries have not risen since
the war started. A driver earns about 200
dinars a month and a university dean or di-
rector-general in a ministry only twice that.
The economy will have to grow if it is to di-
gest the returning soldiers without throwing
Iraq’s women out of their jobs.

Iraq has enormous oil reserves. It has
just come close to winning a long and ardu-
ous war. The one cloud over its future is the
fact that it has fallen under the thrall of a
single, all-powerful ruler. A week ago, when
one of Iraq's most popular generals, Lieut-
General Maher Abdel al-Rashid, command-
er of the seventh army corps, was reported
to have died in an aeroplane crash, some
people wondered if it was really an accident.
There is no proof, but the suspicion is symp-
tomatic. How long can a modern state be
run this way?
