The idea was breathtakingly
simple, the symbolism staggering,
the risks enormous: President
Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt would go to the Jewish state to put his
case before the Parliament of the
Israeli people. And so he has.

Neither Mr. Sadat, nor anyone
else, can yet know what his visit
will mean for Middle East peace&mdash;
or for his own political and per-
sonal fortunes. But the Egyptian
President has by his presence in
Jerusalem implicitly recognized
Israel's existence and, as one
Israeli commented, “the whole
atmosphere has been psychologi-
cally transformed.”

Although there were hints about
Rumanian or Iranian go-betweens,
the trip, arranged with astonishing
speed thanks in part to the press
and American television, appeared
to have caught all parties to Mid-
dle East diplomacy, including
Washington, by surprise.

Though popular opinion in Cairo
seemed to support Mr. Sadat, the
reaction from many Arab leaders,
including members of Mr. Sadat’s
Cabinet, ranged from outrage to dismay
His Foreign Minister of four years, Ismail Fahmy, re-
signed. The leader of Syria, Hafez
al-Assad, anxious that despite Mr.
Sadat’s disclaimers Egypt was
planning a separate peace with Is-
rael, called the initiative danger-
ous and declared yesterday a day
of mourning. The Palestine Libera-
tion Organization, waiting for the
Syrian reaction before comment-
ing in full, then replied with pre-
dictable anger.

Some of the reaction was vio-
lent, with bombings and demon-
strations at Egyptian offices in
several capitals.

Far more important, however,
was the response from Saudi Ara-
bia, bankroller to the belligerent
Arab states and Egypt in particu-
lar. After initial silence, the Sau-
dis, who have often acted as me-
diators' in inter-Arab- quarrels,
expressed concern that Mr. Sadat
would split the Arab ranks, “Any
move with regard to a settlement,”
the Saudis’ cautioned, “must be
within the framework of Arab
unity.” The Soviet Union, fearing
that once again it would be by-
passed in ‘Middle East diplomacy,
warned that Mr, Sadat’s “flirta-
_ion’’ with Israel could lead to
war.

In Washington, Carter Adminis-
tration officials were concerned
that the Egyptian leader receive
tangible concessions from Israel
in return for his extraordinary
personal and political courage.
Otherwise, they feared, he would
be isolated in the Arab world. Yet
in a sense, Mr. Sadat’s vulnerability
is a source of strength. Should he
be overthrown as a result of a fu-
tile visit to Jerusalem, the Israelis
know his successor would almost
certainly take a more hardline
stance; peace prospects would be
crippled indefinitely.

United States officials said they
were urging Israel to compromise
on a formula for Palestinian rep-
resentation at a Geneva confer-
ence, the main procedural question
that has stalled Middle East di-
plomacy for months.

Although the Sadat visit has, for
the moment, eclipsed all other ini-
tiatives, the principal obstacles to
peace remain. At the core, as
always, are the Palestinians. The
Israeli Government continues to
refuse to even contemplate the
creation of a Palestinian state on
the West Bank ef Jordan which
it considers Israel’s by biblical
right.

Unlike most meetings between
heads of state, where the texts of
treaties have been prepared by
subordinates in advance and the
leaders need only initial them, Mr.
Sadat’s discussions with Prime
Minister Menahem Begin of Israel
are completely uncharted. Yet,
whatever the substance of the
talks, even as a gesture the visit
is astonishing — Egypt remains
technically at war with Israel.
Low-level representatives of the
two countries worked out the de-
tails of truce agreements in 1956
and 1973 but all important negoti-
ations have always been conduct-
ed second-hand.

Credit for the historic visit goes
to Mr. Begin as well as to Mr.
Sadat. The Egyptian President,
evidently frustated by the pace of
preparations for Geneva and under
domestic economic pressure to at
least appear to be making
progress toward peace, suggested
the visit in an emotional speech
before his Parliament 12 days ago.
But it was Prime Minister Begin,
with an equal flair for the dramat-
ic, who seized upon the offer,
which was discounted by most Is-
raelis and many others as just so
much rhetoric. Two days later, in
a broadcast on Israel’s Arabic
radio station, he addressed a plea
for peace to the Egyptian people
and told them that their leader
was welcome in Israel.
