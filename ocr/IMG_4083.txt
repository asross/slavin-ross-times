TRIPOLI &mdash; The man selling chocolate bars near Tripoli’s not-so-Grand Hotel had
about him a look of impermanence. His wares were set out on top of a cardboad box into which they could quickly be bundled should a policeman plod by.

Much has been made of the so-called “green <em>perestroika</em>” by which Colonel Moammar Qaddafi has tried to liberalise the Libyan economy. Private enterprise, which the colonel abolished a decade ago, has been temporarily rehabilitated. The old <em>souk</em< off Green Square, where the col- onel once harangued his people with revolutionary gobbledygook from his “Green Book”, reopened six months ago. Now it bustles with traders from every corner of the Levant and the Maghreb. They sell video cameras from Japan, lingerie from Tunisia and jeans from Turkey. Food is dear but abundant.

Personal freedom has also increased. The young zealots of the “revolutionary committees”, who used to terrorise every neighbourhood and workplace, have faded from sight. Some have been executed for crimes against the people. It is said that several thousand political prisoners have been set free since March, when Colonel Qaddafi personally mounted a bulldozer to demolish the entrance of Tripoli’s main prison. Since April, when the colonel used another bulldozer to knock down a border checkpoint, up to 1m of Libya’s 4m people have crossed on shopping sprees into neighbouring Tunisia. Some critics of the regime find it hard to cross back.

Television propaganda is less raucous than it was in 1986, the last time Libya had an armed clash with the United States. On television newscasts a map of the Arab world has replaced the map of a world in which America, Britain and South Africa were blacked out and Israel did not exist at all. Viewers see more musical variety shows. Of the bleach-blonde Maltese lady with frosted purple lipstick who, three years ago, warbled slogans from the Green Book to a discotheque beat, there is thankfully no sign.

On the streets posters of the colonel are often frayed; some look as if they have been defaced. The Leader of the Revolution makes fewer speeches and dresses less often in glitzy outfits. He appeared before chemical-weapons-hunting western journalists at the the Grand Hotel on January 7th wearing a simple brown woollen cape.  European diplomats say the colonel wants to be seen as a somewhat loveable elder statesman.

Much of the change, however, is costume-deep. Ordinary people are afraid to discuss politics with foreigners and still take orders from miscellaneous thought-policemen. Libya meddles less openly than it once did in the affairs of its neighbours mainly because it is still smarting from its army’s disastrous performance in Chad and from the American bombing raids of April 1986.

Another constraint is the economy. Libya is one of Africa’s richest countries, but the oil that enriched it fetches a lower price than it used to. Few new construction schemes are under way, and the second stage of the “Great Man-Made River Project’’, a colossal scheme to pump water from desert aquifers to the arid coastal re gions, has been postponed. Colonel Qaddafi’s confidence, and his coffers, have taken a knock. But is his flair for mischief really punctured?
