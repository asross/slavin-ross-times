U.S. negotiators leave

Continued from 1A

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon

wants to end Arafat's ability to act
as the leader of the Palestinians,
charging he is responsible for ter-
rorism. Yet the harder Sharon tries,
the more Palestinians proclaim al-
legiance to the man who has sym-
bolized their cause for more than

three decades.

Cover story

In addition to trying to isolate
Arafat, Israel is demanding that the
Palestinians hand over two wanted
men alleged to be inside the com-
pound: One is accused of involve-
ment in the assassination of Israel's
tourism minister and the other of
arranging an Iranian arms ship-
ment to Palestinians.

Foreign reporters got a view of
life inside the compound Sunday
for the first time in two weeks
when Powell and Arafat met for
three hours. The U.S. media made
the 45-minute trip from Jerusalem
to Ramallah in a caravan of ar-
mored vans.

The West Bank city was under
curfew. Most of the houses ap-

stalled ON The Cdl GUIiIS Ule HeAL

peared to be intact, but there were
a number of wrecked cars lining

the streets.

Powell arrived in a separate con-
voy of armored cars and vans.
State Department security offi-
cials, wearing full body armor and
carrying machine guns and side
arms, escorted the diplomats and
journalists past Israeli troops into
the compound.

Before the U.S. entourage ar-
rived Sunday — a day later than
planned because of the latest sui-
cide bombing in Jerusalem that
killed six Israelis and a female
bomber — Israeli soldiers tried to
clear a path to the headquarters
through the rubble left by Israel's
17-day siege.

Soldiers cleaned up the court-
yard outside the building on Sat-
urday night, hauling away the
crushed remains of about 40 cars
run over by Israeli tanks. But
shards of giass still littered the

ground, along with empty bottles
of Israeli mineral water and dis-

carded wrappers from Israeli
cookies.

Tuna and sardines

The Israelis had cut off running
water and electricity to the com-
pound but recently installed a gen-
erator. The International Red Cross
has been allowed to make limited
deliveries of food and medicine.

Mohammed Mashargqa, 42, a re-
porter for the Ramallah newspa-
per Al Ayam who has been staying
inside the building, says the occu-
pants are largely subsisting on
canned tuna and sardines. .

ta ine for Powell's visit Sun-
day, the Israelis brought fresh un-
derwear for their captives on Sat-
urday and jury-rigged a water pipe
to allow everyone inside to take a
sponge bath.

But an Israeli bulldozer clearing
away the wrecked cars broke the

pipe later in the day, again leaving
the Palestinians without running,
water, people inside say.

Palestinians also have trouble
using their cellphones, but the Is-
raelis lifted their jamming while
the US. party was in Ramallah on
Sunday.

Zeid Abu Shawish, a Palestinian
surgeon who has been tending to
the occupants, says he urgently
needs medical supplies, but “first
of all, water.” :

Eight Palestinians and five Euro-
peans have come down with diar-
thea in recent days, he says, be-
cause of the unsanitary conditions.
He says he is afraid that intestinal
ailments will spread. He also has
requested painkillers, antibiotics,
gauze and syringes.

tinian leader's physical condition
remains good despite the “unusual
pressure for an old man like him.”

An ambulance is parked just
outside in case Arafat, 72, becomes
seriously ill. But the Palestinian
leader has vowed not to leave until
the Israelis pull their forces out of
the West Bank city.

with grim faces

Among the banners hung by
demonstrators at the compound
are several that criticize the United
States for taking Israel's side in the
18¥%-month conflict. “Passivity =
Complicity,” one says.

The journalists were confined to
4 small room in one of the build-
ings and to a small area in the
courtyard just outside the en-
trance. Reporters were not per-
mitted to film Israeli troops, which
are stationed in the courtyard and
a building just 40 yards away,

Several of the structures
showed clear evidence of recent
fighting: There were holes from ar-
tillery shells and the masonry was

unctured by Israeli tanks. One
nearby tank's turret was constant-
ly moving, occasionally pointing at
the gathered U.S. reporters.

Right at the doorstep

On Powell's last visit, Israeli secu-
rity escorted the secretary of State
to the outskirts of Ramallah, where
they handed off security to Pales-
tinian police. Israeli forces now are
parked at Arafat's doorstep.

The Palestinian leader, still at-
tempting to be a gracious host,
served Powell and the US. dele-
gation a chocolate cake donated to
e the Palestinians last week by a
Norwegian diplomat.

But Arafat did not meet Powell
at the door. Instead, Saeb Erekat, a
veteran Palestinian negotiator and
key adviser to Arafat, greeted the
top U.S. diplomat and escorted him
out after the three-hour meeting.
Erekat said Arafat did not come out
of the building for “security rea-

another West Bank town, to the
massacre of 800 Palestinians in

Palestinians say several hundred
people died in Jenin last week as
part of Israel's “Operation Defen-
sive Shield,” a massive military of-
fensive into Palestinian areas that
Sharon says is aimed at hunting
down terrorists responsible for su-
icide bombings inside Israel. More
than two dozen Israelis also were
killed in the operation.
Palestinians and human rights
groups complain that Israel will
not allow access to the bodies of
the dead in Jenin, where there was
house-to-house combat, to deter-
mine how many and who died.
