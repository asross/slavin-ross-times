_ ministries was cut from 21 to 11. The new
education minister, Mr Ahmed Ibrahim,
who has a degree in Colonel Qaddafi’s
philosuphy of the Green Book, this week
tried to close down the English and
French departments of Tripoli’s Fatah
University with a ritual burning of for-
eign books.

Despite the brief excitement in the
Gulf of Sirte, there appears to be little
anti-American feeling, or anti-Qaddafi
dissidénce, among ordinary Libyans.
The colonel’s chief worry is the 75,000
inembers of the armed forces, though he
seems careful to swat potential coup-
makers in time. He is said to have had a
cousin, Colonel Hassan Ishkal, shot last
November for excessive ambition.

‘cording’ to some westerners in Tripoli,
he ee aulte a few Libyans thought that after
“the post-Christmas massacres at Rome
and Vienna airports, for which President
~ Reagan blamed Colonel Qaddafi, the
‘Libyan leader would be got rid of—by
«Libyans: ““We would have been done
} with him in a year. But now we are stuck
with him for another ten.’ That could be
pessimistic.
