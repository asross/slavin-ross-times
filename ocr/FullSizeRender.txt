title: N. Korea admits nuclear program

WASHINGTON — Confronted with new evidence, North Korea has admitted operating a secret nuclear weapons program in defiance of an agreement with the United States.

The surprise development threatens to provoke a confrontation on the Korean peninsula and presents the Bush administration with a second crisis as it contemplates a war with Iraq.

The White House said Wednesday that it considers the secretive communist government “in material breach” of a 1994 agreement in which it promised to freeze its nuclear weapons program.

The administration called on North Korea to “comply with its commitments ... and to eliminate its nuclear weapons program in a verifiable manner,” State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.

North Korea may be pushing toward a crisis to try to win commercial and political concessions from the United States and its allies, experts say. It may also be betting that Washington can't handle another crisis.

Relations between North Korea and the United States have deteriorated since the Bush administration took office. Earlier this year, Bush labeled the country part of an “axis of evil” with Iraq and Iran.

The latest confrontation came Oct. 3-5 in Pyongyang during the highest-level talks between the two countries since the Bush administration took office in January 2001. A U.S. delegation confronted the North Koreans with evidence that North Korea has been trying to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.

The North Koreans initially denied the charge, then came back a day later and admitted it. The US. delegation left the next day and began consulting with its key allies in the region, South Korea and Japan.

Administration officials say they hope for a peaceful resolution, But the situation confronts the administration with a significant problem as it contemplates going to war with Iraq. The suspicion that Iraq continues to hoard chemical and biological weapons is cited by the Bush administration as grounds to threaten that nation with an invasion. By that logic, North Korea — which the CIA says already has one or two nuclear bombs, as well as long-range ballistic missiles — might be a more apt target than Iraq. But any U.S. military action could provoke the North Koreans to attack South Korea, where 37,000 US. troops are based.

North Korea has a track record of going to the brink of war. It refused to cooperate with nuclear inspectors in 1992-94, when it signed an agreement with the Clinton administration to shut down known nuclear installations in return for two civilian nuclear reactors.

US. officials declined to specify their new evidence. But David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security and an expert on North Korea's nuclear program, says the evidence shows the North Koreans have purchased equipment to make gas centrifuges, which are used to produce weapons-grade material from ordinary uranium.

“The administration will confront the same problem as the Clinton administration but with fewer options,” says Joel Wit, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The administration may think North Korea will back down, but I'm not sure they will.”
