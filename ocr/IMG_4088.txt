FROM OUR CAIRO CORRESPONDENT, IN AMMAN

ING HUSSEIN of Jordan has his own

way with public relations. In April his
government expelled an American televi-
sion correspondent, and withdrew the cre-
dentials of two Jordanian reporters who had
written extensively, and sometimes criti-
cally, for foreign newspapers: Yet on May
7th he invited two dozen foreign journalists
to a sumptuous supper at his Basman palace
in Amman.

No government likes criticism. Jordan’s
has been more sensitive than usual since last
December, when the 11/2m Palestinians who
live across the Jordan river started their up-
rising against the Israeli occupation. The up-
rising is much admired by Jordanians, but it

_ has reawakened the perennial identity crisis
of a country in which about six out of ten

people consider themselves Palestinians, yet —

are ruled in authoritarian fashion by a royal
dynasty from the Arabian peninsula.

_ whose families have always lived east of the
Jordan river—see the resurgence of Palestin-
- jan nationalism as a threat to King Hussein’s _

Jordanians—those

tried to take over the country. But the gov-
ernment is taking no chances. Demonstra-
tions in support of the uprising over the
river have been few, and tightly controlled.
Jordan is rumoured to have stopped a group
of Palestinians, deported from the Israeli-oc-
cupied West Bank, making a symbolic
march home across the Allenby bridge.
This correspondent, normally based in
Cairo, took advantage of the king’s supper
invitation to visit the teeming Baqaa camp
outside Amman, which is home to 80,000
Palestinian refugees. There, too, the Jorda-
nian authorities showed signs of extreme
nervousness. An official escort refused to
translate questions put to the camp's resi-
dents about the Palestinian uprising across
the river. “Government policy’, he said,
forbade it. Two policemen followed to make

~ sure government policy was obeyed.

As if King Hussein did not have worries
