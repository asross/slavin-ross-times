American wrestlers get a friendly
welcome almost 20 years after Iranian
revolutionaries declared the USA

the ‘Great Satan’ and took hostages

TEHRAN, Iran — The last time a
group of Americans was in this capi-
tal officially representing the USA,
they were taken hostage and held for
444 days.

Nearly two decades later, a dozen
Americans have returned for what
appears certain to be a much shorter
— and less traumatic — stay.

Kevin Jackson, Zeke Jones, Mel-
vin Douglas, Shawn Charles, John
Giura and their coaches arrived
Tuesday to participate in a major in-
ternational wrestling tournament.
Today and Friday, they will grapple
with Iran’s best wrestlers. Win or
lose, they have already made diplo-
matic history.

For the first time since Iran’s 1979
revolution, an American flag flies in
Tehran and nobody is trying to burn
it. Team coach Joe Seay carried the
flag at the tournament’s opening cer-
emony Tuesday and the response
“was unbelievable.” Hundreds of Ira-
nians in the audience at Tehran’s
Freedom Stadium “clapped and
cheered,’ Seay says, giving the
Americans more support than any
other team except their own. “It was
a pleasant surprise.”

The U.S. team had been invited to
Iran, one of the world’s top wrestling
nations, twice in the past few years,
but security fears kept them away.
This time, the Americans decided
the time was right for several rea-
sons, says Jones, 31, a former world
champion and Olympic silver medal-
ist from Chandler, Ariz.

The Americans wanted to check
out the country and its facilities be-
fore this year’s world wrestling
championships, to be held in Tehran
in September.

But first they asked Iran to guaran-
tee their safety.

Mohammed Reza Taleghani, the
head of Iran’s wrestling federation,
“sent a letter to us guaranteeing*our
security,” Jones says.

So far, the only danger the Ameri-
cans appear to face is being tram-
pled by dozens of Iranian body-
guards or the hordes of international
media that dog their every public

step. “I’m the most paranoid of the
group and I’ve felt more than safe
here.” Jones says. He brought two
sets of singlets, the uniforms that
wrestlers wear. One is plain, the oth-
er is covered with American flags.
After the reception the team got
Tuesday at the stadium, he said, “Im
wearing the one with the flags.”

Before their arrival, the Ameri
cans were nervous about venturing
back to what has become a strict Is-
lamic state. “I’ve heard that if you
turn your head and look at a woman,
you can be stoned by the local po-
lice” says Jackson, 32, a former
Olympic gold medalist and world
champion from Gilbert, Ariz.

Iranian propaganda still refers oc-
casionally to the USA as the “Great
Satan.” A key faction in the Iranian
government still uses anti-American-
ism as a potent domestic political
tool. In Iran’s parliament on Wednes-
day, a hard-liner complained about
the unveiling of the US. flag. “They
plan to hoist the American flag and
play their national anthem to rub in
our noses that which we used to
trample underfoot only last year)’
said Mohammad Reza Faker. Fellow
hard-liners chanted “Death to Amer-
ica” after he spoke.

The decision to invite the Ameri-
cans was also criticized by a militant
Tehran newspaper that questioned
whether U.S. athletes would be safe
considering the “Iranian nation’s ha-
tred towards the U.S. government.”

But so far, so good, the Americans
say. The security is So massive and so
overzealous that guards tried to keep
an American reporter from inter-
viewing the athletes in their hotel.
“We've had bodyguards every-

where,” says Seay. “You don't see
the guns, but you know they are
there.” A picture of Iran’s late revo-

lutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruholl
Khomeini, glowered Beoneacite
above him in the lobby of the Free-
dom Hotel, a former Hyatt.

The American decision to g0 to
Tehran was in the works for several
months but was clinched by Iran's
new president, Mohammad Kha-
tami. In an interview with CNN in
January, Khatami signaled for the
first time that Iran was Teady to re-

he concedes that more than medals
are resting on their burly shoulders.
“We're also aware of the interest this
trip has created in us,” he says.

Wrestling seems an appropriate
metaphor for the long-troubled U.S.-
Iranian relationship as well as an apt
means of beginning to restore a sem-
blance of civility and understanding.
In ancient times, Iranian tribes desig-
nated wrestlers to resolve their col-
lective disputes. Wrestlers are also
considered “noble characters,’ says
Amir Reza Khadem, an Iranian
wrestling champion who now is di-
rector of Iran’s national teams.

“It's a good way of moving for-
ward,” says Marks. “Wrestling is al-
most sacrosanct in this society.”

How far this first cautious step will
go toward restoring formal U.S.-Iran

ties remains to be seen. “No one can

expect any miracles from this,’ says
Bruce Laingen, the top diplomat in
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran when it
was seized by militant students on
Nov. 4, 1979. “The miracle in a sense
is that this is happening.”

American journalists, academics
and ordinary citizens of Iranian ori-
gin have been visiting Iran for years.
Iranians have also come to the USA,
including wrestlers who have com-
peted in the United States three
times since 1995. But the U.S. wres-
tlers are the first to represent their
country in any formal way here
since the 1979 revolution.

The wrestlers’ participation in this
week's tournament has been com-
pared to the “ping-pong” diplomacy
that helped restore relations be-
tween the United States and China in
the early 1970s. But the antagonism
still nurtured by the United States
and Iran is deeper.

Iran violated one of the oldest
rules of international conduct when
it seized and kept U.S. diplomats hos-
tage. Humiliation and outrage
caused by the holding of those 52
Americans in 1979-81 is seared into
the consciousness of most Americans
of middle age and older.

Their Iranian counterparts, mean-
while, do not forget that the United
States reinstalled and bolstered for a
quarter century the despotic shah of
Iran, then sided with Iraq in a 1980-

88 war that Iraq started and that cost
Iran nearly half a million dead anda

million wounded.

Perspectives in both nations are
changing, however. Now Iraq is the

has not used them aggressively, as
Iraq has. Secretary of State Made-
leine Albright, on her recent trip to
Europe and the Middle East, made a
point of saying that the United States
was standing up to Baghdad on be-
half of Iranians as well as others in-
the region, the first time in two dec-
ades that the United States has por-
trayed itself as Tehran’s champion.
President Clinton, in a message to
Muslims at the end of the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan last month,
echoed Khatami, saying, “The Unit-
ed States regrets the estrangement of
our two nations.” Clinton then went
further, adding he hoped “the day
will soon come when we can enjoy
once again good relations with Iran.”

interested in emulating the wealth
