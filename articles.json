    "title": "Attack on politburo sparked Yemeni civil war",
    "text": "ADEN - A bid by former president Ali Nasser Mohammed to massacre his rivals in the politburo of the ruling Yemeni Socialist party, sparked a civil war that left up to 12,000 dead last month, South Yemeni officials say.<br><br>Survivors of the massacre said that Mohammed called the politburo together at 10 a.m. on Jan. 13 but did not attend himself. Instead, he sent his bodyguards, who went through the motions of preparing the president's papers and serving tea to the others. Opened fire<br><br>These courtesies dispensed with, the bodyguards produced machine pistols and opened fire on the men in the room, killing several of the president's opponents, including Vice-president Ali Ahmed Antar and Defence Minister Salih Muslih Qasim.<br><br>The shooting summoned the victims' bodyguards and a wild gunfight erupted. Salim and two other politburo members escaped.<br><br>The fighting escalated quickly after that, and by the next day fierce rocket and tank battles were raging in several parts of the city between opposing units of the armed forces and the tribal militias summoned down from the surrounding hills. The evacuation of foreigners began on Friday, Jan. 17, on the fifth day of the fighting that was to last for another week. After several failed attempts, the Soviets arranged a limited truce on a beachfront near their battered embassy in Khormaksar, one of two districts in the city where the heaviest fighting took place. The first to leave, aboard a Soviet freighter, were women and children.<br><br>The next day, about 800 people, among them most of the diplomatic community, gathered on the beach at daybreak to await evacuation by the British royal yacht Britannia, which was in the area en route to New Zealand when the fighting broke out.<br><br>As Bryan Wannop, the resident representative of the United Nations Development Program, said later, the evacuation was proceeding as planned when, in mid-morning, with half the evacuees still waiting on the beach, the Britannia suddenly turned and steamed away.<br><br>\"We were flabbergasted,\" recalled Wannop, a Canadian. \"At first we couldn't believe it. Without warning, they set sail and left us.\" The commander of the Britannia, Admiral John Garnier, later told reporters the ceasefire was collapsing and that shelling was advancing toward the beach, forcing a suspension of the evacuation. But Wannop said the area around the beachfront was calm for another 20 hours.<br><br>The evacuees spent the next several days huddled in basements and moving from building to building in search of food and water, both of which were running low. Some put sugar in seawater to make it potable. At the British embassy, they drank and bathed in champagne. During this time, while the Soviets and the British continued to try to negotiate a truce and select an alternate evacuation site, two heroes emerged - Wannop and Abbas Zaki, senior representative in Aden of the Palestine Liberation Organization.<br><br>Zaki was several hundred kilometres from Aden, in a remote part of the country, when the fighting broke out. Upon hearing the news, he drove to the capital, arriving on the fourth day. Under his direction, the PLO ran supply convoys for the foreigners, crossing the lines to bring back food and bottled water scavanged from abandoned apartment buildings.\"The PLO played a very responsible role; they helped the rest of us immensely,\" said Wannop, who himself led convoys around the city, a white flag flying from his car, to help gather together foreigners stranded in different areas.<br><br>After the first week, the fighting began to taper off as Mohammed's resistance crumbled. Scattered shooting continued, but by the 10th day an evacuation route had been secured through rebel territory from Khormaksar to Little Aden, site of a sprawling oil refinery west of the capital.<br><br>By Thursday morning, Jan. 23, the rescue operation had been completed as the last of nearly 7,000 foreigners - 5,000 Soviet nationals and 2,000 people of other nationalities - set out for the Red Sea port of Djibouti in Soviet, French and British ships.<br><br>Aden is quiet now, and much of the war damage has been cleared away. Members of the new \"collective leadership,\" in their first interviews with Western reporters, said they want the foreigners to return as soon as possible to finish work on the various projects abandoned in the fighting.<br><br>The new leaders are also mounting a propaganda campaign to expose what they assert were the myriad crimes of \"Ali Nasser and his conspiratorial clique.\" They complain about descriptions of themselves in the Western press as Marxist hardliners and seem eager to portray their differences with Mohammed as personal rather than ideological.<br><br>It seems unlikely that Mohammed can make a military comeback, but with outside support he could be a threat and a source of instability for his successors.<br><br>Aware of this, the new leaders have taken pains to assure people in the other Yemen and in the surrounding Persian Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait that they will continue to pursue Mohammed's conciliatory foreign policies and keep the door open to Western investment.<br><br>But for the time being at least most of the gulf countries seem to be unconvinced. Many seem to be waiting for the outcome of what they are certain will be another power struggle between the survivors before recognizing the new government.<br><br>At the moment, the government is headed, nominally, by Mohammed's prime minister, Haider abu Bakr Attas, who was visiting India when the fighting broke out. Authoritative sources point out that Attas has no independent tribal power base and they believe that he will be in office only so long as the jittery gulf states need assurances that the old regime's moderate foreign policies will continue.<br><br>Emerging strongman<br><br>In the meantime, the emerging strongman, according to these sources, seems to be Salim Saleh Mohammed, secretary of the central committee of the Yemeni Socialist party and a survivor of the Jan. 13 ambush.<br><br>Mohammed, 39, fought the British as a teenager. He has held a series of senior party posts and served as foreign minister under Ali Nasser Mohammed from 1980 to 1983.<br><br>Bidh, the local government minister, is a possible rival. The Soviet news agency Tass reported several days ago that he had been chosen to succeed Salim Saleh Mohammed as party secretary. But western diplomats see this as a sign that Mohammed will succeed Attas as president. Questions remain concerning the Soviet Union's murky role in the coup. Some Western diplomats monitoring events from afar say it is inconceivable to them that the Soviet Union did not know that a move to oust Ali Nasser Mohammed was afoot.<br><br>"

    "title": "TV addiction grows in China",
    "text": "The Chinese may not know who shot J.R. yet, but more and more of them are becoming addicted to television -- a development that offers both promise and problems for China's leadership.<br><br>Armed with marching orders to go forth and 'enrich the cultural life of the masses,' the television industry has been at the forefront of China's effort to shrug off the legacy of the chaotic Cultural Revolution and merge into the modern world. There are now an estimated 16 million TV sets in China reaching 400 million people -- 40 percent of China's population and nearly twice the population of the United States. Production of TV sets -- still mostly small black-and-white models - increased from 3,000 sets in 1968 to 4.8 million in 1981.<br><br>A 12-inch black-and-white set, at $210, is fast becoming standard equipment in urban households. A top-of- the-line, 20-inch color TV is a status symbol whose $1,100 price tag, equal to three years salary for the average worker, apparently is no deterrent to the new Chinese consumer.<br><br>China's one national channel and its 29 regional stations each broadcast about 30 hours per week.<br><br>'Television is coming along very, very rapidly here,' a Western diplomat said. 'It's now about where it was in the 1950s in the United States.'<br><br>The major limitation now is programming which, for technological and ideological reasons, still lags far behind the demand it has created.<br><br>General programming in the evenings and on Sundays is still dominated by a handful of 'proletarian' dramas whose predictable plots have been run and rerun ad nauseam. 'They show the same shows over and over and I already know what's going to happen,' confided one Chinese viewer, who requested anonymity because revolutionary inspiration in China is not supposed to be boring. Maybe because of this, the most popular program in China is the nightly news, 30 minutes of local, national and international reportage.<br><br>On the news the other night, a young woman with a Western hairdo and a smart white dress provided the narration as the screen behind her dissolved from the determined face of a Chinese soccer player kicking home a goal to an image of Beirut burning under the thunder of Israeli guns.<br><br>The news in China is one of the few programs that's always changing, which helps account for its appeal.<br><br>Faced with increasing demand, officials are expanding production of made-for-TV dramas and looking abroad for foreign fare.<br><br>The 'Man from Atlantis' was shown two years ago and a regional station is negotiating for the old 'Rifleman' series.<br><br>The Chinese recently concluded an agreement for 24 National Geographic specials and a delegation is going to the United States this October to talk to serial distributors. 'The problem,' one Western diplomat said, 'is that up to now the Chinese have been unwilling to pay the going rate.' They are only just coming to accept that they must part with some of their foreign exchange for the likes of'Kramer Vs. Kramer,' a film they have expressed an interest in.<br><br>'They can buy an awful lot of 'Leave it to Beaver' if they want to,' the diplomat said. 'But they realize their viewers want something more than that.' "

But, although Hu said improving the lot of the peasants and generally raising living standards was the country's first economic goal, he warned it would probably take another decade for the full benefits of the ambitious economic drive to trickle down to the masses.<br><br>Hu also called for an increase in Chinese exports and reiterated Deng's pledge to keep the economic door open to the West.<br><br>On Wednesday, Deng declared that China will 'unswervingly follow the policy of opening to the outside world,' but the 78-year-old leader also made an apparent concession to those concerned with side effects of foreign contact.<br><br>'At the same time,' he said, 'we will keep a clear head, firmly resist corosion by decadent ideas from abroad and never permit the bourgeois way of life in our country.'<br><br>Reunifcation with Taiwan, modernization with Western help and fighting hegemony -- China's code word for Soviet expansion -- are the goals for this decade, Deng said.

    "title": "IN CAIRO, IT'S RAINING CATS AND MORE CATS",
    "text": "HASSAN Hafez, a senior member of Egypt's Parliament, was sitting at his desk, discoursing on the merits of using waste water for land reclamation, when his exposition was interrupted by a commotion in the hall.<br><br>Moments later, a round, furry projectile, slightly larger than a football, flew through the air and landed on Hafez's desk. Then, scattering papers and pens to the floor, it bounded off and disappeared around a corner, with a broom-wielding janitor in hot pursuit. Hafez barely had time to recover his papers, if not his composure, when the scene was repeated. The furry football bounded once more across the desk and flew out the door, followed by the red-faced janitor. There was a moment of embarrassed silence.<br><br>\"I am very truly sorry,\" Hafez said, bending over to pick up his papers again. \"But we just can't seem to keep the cats out.\" There are some who might argue that Cairo, with its noise, its traffic, its pollution and its exasperating but cheerful inefficiency, has gone to the dogs. But those who know this city recognise the absurdity of such a statement. Cairo, they will tell you, long ago went to the cats.<br><br>Consider:<br><br>* Cats prowl the corridors of power in the Foreign Ministry, where they can be seen after hours lounging on the delicately carved, gilt antique settees in the diplomatic waiting rooms.<br><br>* Cats cavort on stage at the National Theatre, where more than once they have upstaged a mediocre performance, to the chagrin of the performers if not of the delighted audience.<br><br>* Cats routinely slip past the security at Cairo Airport, mingling with the passengers in the departure lounges and occasionally stowing away on an outbound flight.<br><br>\"Cats are very much a part of life in Cairo,\" observed a longtime resident who recently adopted the cat that kept following her into the lift. \"Egyptians don't much care for dogs, but they pretty much let cats do as they please.\"<br><br>No-one really knows how many cats there are in Cairo, but they can be found just about everywhere. There are city cats that prowl the back alleys, socialise among the rubbish and, when the weather is nice, lounge on the roofs of parked cars. There are river cats that hunt mice, rats and other small game along the banks of the Nile. There are even desert cats that live on the Giza plateau and that can frequently be found sunning themselves on the summits of the pyramids. Indeed, so ubiquitous are the cats of Cairo that, as this story is written, one is sitting in the writer's lap.<br><br>\"No-one knows how many cats there are in Cairo because there are far too many of them to count,\" Boulous Malek, a veterinarian and Egypt's leading expert on rabies, said recently. \"In my house alone, we have three or four permanent residents living on the landings and several more in the garden.\"<br><br>Malek estimates that there must be \"five or six cats for every house in Cairo, at the very least\". Does this mean there are too many cats in Cairo?<br><br>\"Some might say that,\" Malek said, \"but those who do should remember that without this many cats, Cairo would have a lot more rats.\"Anyone familiar with feline history knows that Egyptians were the first people cats chose to associate with about 4,000 years ago. From the cats'point of view, the relationship was put in its proper perspective from the outset: Egyptians worshipped them.<br><br>Cats were considered sacred for their eyes which, because they glowed in the dark, were believed to hold the light of the sun and to keep evil spirits away during the night.<br><br>Cats are also esteemed, if not revered, in much of the Muslim world. Mohammed is said to have had a cat. According to legend, the reason cats always land on their feet, never on their backs, is because Mohammed used to stroke his cat on the back, thereby charming it.<br><br>Today, cats are not held in the same high regard as they once were. Although Cairo, with its dogs, cats, sheep, camels, horses and donkeys, is more of a menagerie than most large cities, few Egyptians own a pet or think of animals as anything other than beasts of burden or a source of protein.<br><br>\"In general, Egyptians are not pet lovers,\" Malek lamented. \"Those who do have them, don't take very good care of them.\" There are exceptions, of course.<br><br>\"One of my clients,\" Malek said, \"is a woman who owns 12 cats, and every time one of them doesn't eat for a day she thinks it is dying. She will call four veterinarians to her house at the same time, often in the middle of the night.\"<br><br>Perhaps Egypt's best-known cat lover is Hassan Fathy, the internationally renowned architect, who lives in a meticulously restored Islamic-era apartment.<br><br>\"I have 20, maybe 30, cats,\" Fathy once told an interviewer. \"It all depends on who shows up for dinner that day.\"<br><br>The US Embassy in Cairo also keeps cats, although the ambassador may or may not know it. Secretaries take turns sneaking out to feed them.<br><br>Occasionally, one reads in Egyptian newspapers that an airliner has been forced to return to Cairo because of cats in the cabin. Two years ago, an Egyptair Airbus was grounded for two days while airline personnel tried unsuccessfully to coax a feline stowaway out of the cabin. But Cairo's most famous cats are the cats of the Gomhuria Theatre. These musical cats have been known, on more than one occasion, to add their unique accompaniment to the arias from La Traviata.<br><br>But top theatrical honours go to the cat that appeared on stage a few years ago during a piano recital. No-one can recall who the pianist was or what he played, but the cat is widely remembered.<br><br>Appearing on stage after the pianist's concentration had already been broken by the sound of a slamming door and a loudly ringing telephone, the cat crept up to the piano and, evidently fascinated by the quick movement of the pianist's fingers, leapt on to the keyboard. The pianist, clearly no cat lover, stood up, bowed briskly and stalked off the stage, leaving the cat to bask in the applause of the delighted audience. "

    "text": "For a party not present at the courtship, the United States is throwing one heck of a wedding. About 3,000 people are expected to jam the south lawn of the White House today to witness the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.<br><br>Millions more will watch the historic reconciliation of these bitter foes on live television in 100 countries. Both Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO chief Yasser Arafat will attend the ceremony.<br><br>Although lesser figures are to sign the peace accord, supporters of the agreement hope the spectacle of Rabin and Arafat on the same podium will serve the same function as the late Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 - to help shatter the psychological preconceptions that have long prevented peace in the Middle East and provide momentum to overcome the likely obstacles to implementing the accord.<br><br>\"\"I am hopeful that this will lead to peace,'' said Arafat, whose arrival Sunday afternoon at Andrews Air Force Base had many onlookers pinching themselves in disbelief.<br><br>Unlike the Sadat trip, which won adulation in the West but was widely condemned in the Arab world, the Israeli-Palestinian agreement might actually lead to the comprehensive peace that has so long eluded the region.<br><br>Jordan and Israel are ready to sign a framework for a peace treaty at the State Department onTuesday. And breakthroughs with Syria and Lebanon, with which Israel has also been negotiating for nearl two years, should be easier to achieve.<br><br>For now, the spotlight is directed toward what has long been considered the irreconcilable core of the Arab- Israeli conflict: the century-old struggle between Arabs and Jews over who has the right to the historic land of Palestine.<br><br>The actual accord, reached in months of secret negotiations in Norway, promises self-rule for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho by spring, with autonomy to be extended to other Palestinian towns and villages by next summer.<br><br>Negotiations to determine the final status of the territories Israel captured in the 1967 war are to start in two years. The most contentious issues - the fate of Jerusalem and Israeli settlers in the territories and whether there will be a Palestinian state - are left to this final phase.<br><br>Rabin said Sunday that his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, would sign the accord for Israel. Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the PLO's political department and with Peres an architect of the agreement, is expected to sign for the Palestinians. Arafat had hoped that he and Rabin would be the signatories. But Israeli officials said Rabin, having gone so far in recognizing an organization that has been synonymous with anti-Israel terrorism, did not want to give Arafat the appearance of being an equal chief of state.<br><br>Asked in an interview on CNN if he would shake the PLO leader's hand, Rabin at first dodged the question and then only grudgingly replied, \"\"If it will be needed.''<br><br>Rabin planned to return to Israel a few hours after the signing, obliging the White House to cancel a planned dinner with Arafat. Instead the PLO leader will borrow a tactic of American politicians and appear on Larry King Live on CNN. Among those expected to witness the signing ceremony will be former Presidents Jimmy Carter and GeorgeBush, who both played significant roles in promoting Middle East peace. The agreement is to be signed on the table used at Camp David on Sept. 17, 1978, to seal the agreement between Israel and Egypt that led to the first, and until today only, peace treaty between Israel and an Arab state. Half a dozen foreign ministers, scores of other diplomats, nearly the entire membership of Congress, leaders of Jewish and Arab-American organizations and assorted presidential friends will also be present. There is no doubt, however, that the White House guest who will attract the most attention will be the PLO leader.<br><br>Known for his checkered headdress, green combat fatigues and a clipped salt-and-pepper beard that in photographs appears to be stubble, Arafat has often appeared to be almost a caricature of himself.<br><br>In his last visit to the United States, in 1974, he addressed the United Nations with a gun on his hip. On his arrival Sunday, he was wearing a formal military uniform but the gun was gone.<br><br>Today, according to his aides, not only will he be unarmed but he will wear something he has never worn in public appearances before - a business suit.<br><br>Putting his fate in the hands of the Secret Service, Arafat was brought by helicopter to his Washington hotel. Decoy limousines arrived at the entrance, where dozens of Arab-Americans waited with Palestinian flags. The PLO, founded in 1964, has been responsible for some of the world's most horrific terrorist acts, such as the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Palestinians also have suffered greatly in the conflict. Hundreds died when Israeli soldiers permitted Lebanese militia to slaughter the inhabitants of Sabra and Chatila, two Beirut refugee camps, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel commandos have assassinated PLO leaders, including PLO co- founder Khalil al-Wazir.<br><br>Although the PLO gradually changed its tactics after the Lebanon debacle and in 1988 declared its desire for a negotiated solution with Israel, for many Israelis and American Jews, the sight of Arafat at the White House may still be too much to bear.<br><br>For Arab-Americans and others who have long argued that Israel had to someday sit down with the PLO, it may seem too good to be true.<br><br>\"\"To think of Arafat as a legitimate interlocutor of the state of Israel is a rather traumatic event,'' said Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress and a supporter of the accord. \"\"People are concerned about whether this is for real.''<br><br>At Arafat's Washington hotel, where a Jewish wedding was just ending as the PLO delegation arrived, many of the guests were apprehensive but elated. \"\"It's scary but the potential is so exciting, like a marriage,'' said the bride, Barbara Tannenbaum Epstein, originally from Lake City, as a band played the Jewish song To Life in the background. \"\"It's a perfect day and a wonderful opportunity.''<br><br>Today's ceremony TIME: 11 a.m.<br><br>PLACE: South Lawn of the White House.<br><br>TELEVISION: ABC, CBC, NBC and CNN plan live coverage of the signing ceremony.<br><br>SCENE: The ceremony will take place on a 16-foot by 24-foot stage. The signing will be conducted on the 124- year-old table used for the 1979 Camp David peace accords.<br><br>GUESTS: Officials say guests include former Presidents Bush and Carter; dozens of foreign ministers, most members of Congress, former secretaries of state, leader of the American Arab and Jewish communities;officials who worked on the Camp David peace accords; and officials who worked on the Madrid talks in the Bush administration.<br><br>ON STAGE: Seven people: President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Arafat lieutenant Mahmoud Abbas, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Secretary of State Warren Christopher."

    "text": "CAIRO - Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat, in a thinly veiled and highly unorthodox endorsement of the Israeli Labor Party, has urged Arab citizens of Israel to participate in their country's Nov. 1 elections.<br><br>Arafat's comments, reported by Egypt's Middle East News Agency, came at a press conference in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, where he and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew Sunday from Jordan following a summit with Jordanian King Hussein.<br><br>The consultations in Jordan also seemed intended to bolster the Labor Party by reviving the impression of cooperation between the PLO and Jordan, whose ties have been severely strained, and by resurrecting the idea of a ''federation'' between Jordan and a Palestinian homeland.<br><br>Upon returning to Cairo, Mubarak was quoted as saying that Arafat had agreed to such a confederation.<br><br>However, Saad Kamel, a PLO representative in Egypt who also took part in the Jordan talks, said no agreement on this sensitive matter had been reached and a decision would be left to a meeting next month of the Palestine National Council, an informal parliament representing Palestinians around the world.<br><br>Hussein, who barely three months ago drew back from peace diplomacy and essentially dared the PLO to achieve its aims without him, said only that he and Arafat had agreed ''to continue contacts to coordinate positions in the service of the Palestinian cause.''<br><br>Egypt, the only Arab nation to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, sought the Hussein-Arafat summit to revive the so-called ''Jordan option'' that is advocated by the Israeli Labor Party. Arab moderates prefer Labor to the rival Likud bloc because Labor is willing to participate in an international peace conference on the Middle East and to relinquish some of the territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war.<br><br>In contrast, Likud has vowed not to give up an inch of the West Bank of the Jordan River, which was part of the ancient kingdom of Israel.<br><br>At his news conference, Arafat announced that the PLO had issued two ''important statements'' to Israeli voters. One urged Arabs living within the pre-1967 borders of Israel, who have the right to vote unlike those in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, to take part in the parliamentary elections to ''push forward the peace process.''<br><br>The second statement, addressed to Jewish voters, asked them to choose between war and peace. It noted that leaders of the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza had so far refrained from using firearms and promised continued restraint ''to show the Israeli citizens that the way of peace and not of war and bloodshed is best for our children.''<br><br>Taken with several other recent developments, some of them coordinated with the Labor Party, the PLO appeals represent an unprecedented Arab intrusion into Israeli domestic politics.<br><br>Arab officials admitted there was a danger that their efforts could backfire and drive voters to Likud, but they said this was a risk they were willing to take.<br><br>''We want the Israeli voter, whether Arab or Jew, to understand where his specific interest lies,'' said Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's chief foreign policy adviser. ''Let him know when he casts his vote that there is an Arab partner ready for negotiations.''"

    "text": "CAIRO, Egypt - With almost no fuel left and the passengers said to be in such panic that many were vomiting, a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet landed in Cyprus Friday after the pilot, pleading for mercy, radioed that he was going to be forced to crash into the sea.<br><br>The airliner, hijacked Tuesday by terrorists seeking the release of Shiite Moslem militants imprisoned in Kuwait, had taken off earlier in the day from Mashhad airport in northeastern Iran on what for some 50 hostages still on board was to be a terror-filled odyssey across the Middle East in search of an airport willing to let them land.<br><br>``Thank you, thank you. I'll never forget this,'' the pilot said in a voice choked with emotion as Cypriot officials finally relented and cleared the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 for landing at Larnaca Airport, where it touched down Friday evening, reportedly with only a few minutes of fuel left in its tanks.<br><br>Cypriot authorities immediately cordoned off the airport, declared a state of emergency and suspended all other air traffic. Foreign Minister George Iacovou went to Larnaca to establish contact with the hijackers, who have not identified themselves but are believed to be Lebanese Shiite Moslems. Passengers freed earlier in Iran have given different estimates for the number of hijackers, but there are said to be at least five and perhaps as many as seven.<br><br>In London, 18 freed British hostages got an emotional greeting from their families and an official government welcome when they landed at Heathrow Airport, The Associated Press reported.<br><br>They were brought home by a British Airways jet diverted from Dubai to Kuwait to pick them up.<br><br>``Everyone was charging around the lounge trying to find their family,'' said Mark Appleby, 23. He was returning from a vacation in Thailand with his sister Nicola and family friend Sue Silcock, 21, when the plane was hijacked. ``There was a lot of hugging,'' Appleby said.<br><br>Some passengers, looking pale and drawn, left the airport quickly after the reunion, escorted by police, government officials and airport security to their cars. Some leaned on the arms of relatives.<br><br>Scott Stillwell, a 23-year-old photographer, said: ``We weren't harmed. They seemed very well-trained. I don't think they are afraid to die.'' The gunmen commandeered the Kuwait-bound aircraft several hours after it took off Tuesday from Bangkok and diverted it to Mashhad, where over the next three days they released 57 of the 112 people on board. The remaining hostages are said to include 30 Kuwaitis and a number of other Arabs. Among the Kuwaiti hostages are three members of Kuwait's ruling al Sabah family. Iranian authorities, who at Kuwait's request had refused to allow the plane to leave Mashhad, relented Friday morning and gave the pilot clearance to take off after the hijackers threw a hand grenade onto the runway and beat one of the passengers in front of the cockpit radio so his screams could be heard by officials in the control tower.<br><br>For the weary Iraqi pilot and his remaining passengers, the hours that followed turned into a daylong nightmare in which the terror of one moment was quickly eclipsed by the horror of the next. As one airport after another denied it permission to land, the plane flew west across Iran and Turkey to Cyprus, where it initially was turned away. Circling, it then sought permission to land in Beirut or Damascus, Syria, but again was denied permission to land.By the time the jet landed at Larnaca, a little more than seven hours after leaving Iran, the pilot reported that his fuel gauges showed ``zero, repeat, zero readings on all tanks.''<br><br>The most dramatic stage of the flight came as the jet circled Beirut Airport for nearly three hours, with the pilot repeatedly pleading for permission to land. But the monitored radio conversations between the plane and the control tower indicated that Lebanese officials and Syrian military authorities, whose troops control the airport, were adamant in their refusal.<br><br>``If you try to land by force, you will be fired upon,'' the control tower warned.<br><br>``A gun is pointed at my head. I request landing permission to refuel,'' the pilot said.<br><br>``We (Lebanese) have been for 14 years under gunfire,'' the traffic controller answered coldly, still refusing to let the plane land.<br><br>``Please, please. I beg you, I kiss your hand,'' the pilot said. ``I have human lives at stake here. If you don't let me land, I will have to crash into the sea.''<br><br>``Do whatever you want,'' the voice from the control tower replied. ``Crash on the tarmac or in the sea. We will not let you land here.'' At one point, the plane suddenly began to dive toward the control tower, sending people on the ground running in panic. But it pulled up at the last minute.<br><br>It was at that point, apparently, that officials in Larnaca, 25 minutes' flying time away, relented and radioed their approval for the jumbo jet to land. "

    "text": "CAIRO - Worshipped as a god and then admired for thousands of years as one of man's most wondrous creations, the Great Sphinx of Egypt still looks impressive when seen from afar.<br><br>Viewed from up close, the massive statue with the lion's body and the pharaoh's face inspires pity more than awe.<br><br>Its noseless visage appears battered and bludgeoned. One eye is blurry, and its upper lip is mostly gone. Its body is a hodge-podge of repair jobs, old and modern. If the Sphinx could talk, it might ask to be buried in sand again and left alone. As a symbol of the grandeur that was Egypt and one of the premier tourist attractions of the country today, the Sphinx has not been allowed that luxury. Instead, it has become something of a political controversy and an archaeologists' guinea pig.<br><br>In ancient Greek mythology, the Sphinx was a frightful creature that devoured travelers who failed to answer a riddle. Egypt's version has proved dangerous to directors of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization who failed to solve the mystery of the 4,600-year-old monument's accelerating deterioration.<br><br>The latest victim, Ahmed Kadry, was fired last month after a 500-pound piece of the Sphinx's right shoulder broke loose and tumbled to the ground.<br><br>While the main reason for his removal was said by insiders to be personal animosity with the new minister of culture, the pretext had precedent and a nice historical irony. Kadry got his job in 1981 after his predecessor was made to take the blame for the collapse of part of the Sphinx's left hind paw.<br><br>Then as now, a great hue and cry went up in the Egyptian media and a new campaign to ''save the Sphinx'' was hastily mounted. For the next six years, stones from previous restorations dating back to 700 B.C. were removed from the lower portion of the statue and replaced with hundreds of new limestone blocks. Before the work was halted last December, the venerable creature's paws, rump and tail were entirely encased in new stones. Reaction to the work among many foreign experts and Egyptians not involved in the project was scathing.<br><br>''It's awful-looking,'' said a senior member of one of the half-dozen Western archaeological institutes in Cairo. ''Those stones would look better on a bank.'' Aesthetic complaints aside, the reconstruction did not address, and may have aggravated, the underlying causes for the Sphinx's deterioration.<br><br>The statue has never had much immunity, experts say, because it was made from weak material. While the adjacent pyramids were built on top of the Giza plateau from rugged limestone blocks, the Sphinx was hewn by the architects of the Pharaoh Chephren from a piece of the plateau itself, left in the middle of a quarry at the plateau's edge. The rock is among the world's oldest, perhaps 50-million years old, and is composed of three geological layers. The Sphinx's midsection is particularly fragile, a club sandwich of soft and hard limestone that has eroded at different rates, giving the body a wavy profile. The 100-ton head is composed of harder stone, and experts have long worried that it might topple from the statue's decaying neck. Repair jobs were repeatedly done in ancient times through the early Christian era. Then for centuries, under ensuing Moslem governments, the Sphinx was largely ignored and preserved by being buried in the sand. Fully excavated for the first time in the 1920s, it has been succumbing in recent years to a process calledefflorescence that is also attacking many other Egyptian monuments.<br><br>Excessive moisture - perhaps due to the Aswan High Dam, which has raised the water table all over Egypt, perhaps as a result of local overpopulation and non-existent sewers - is sucked into the statue, where it dissolves salts. The salty solution is then drawn to the surface, where it recrystallizes, undermining surface stones, which eventually crumble into dust.<br><br>Cement used to join the limestone blocks in the latest restoration has probably added to the salt problem, said Zahi Hawass, the new director of antiquities for the Giza plateau.<br><br>''The Sphinx has cancer,'' he said. ''If you add new stones, the cancer is still inside the Sphinx.'' Dr. Hawass heads a new committee of Egyptian and foreign experts charged with saving the statue. They have tentatively decided to put back the piece of the shoulder that fell with metal rods, of stainless steel or titanium. They hope to control the level of the water under the Sphinx through the use of existing wells. Dr. Hawass said the local authorities had also agreed on the need to build a sewer system for the village of souvenir sellers that has developed a few hundred yards from the Sphinx.<br><br>This campaign, he vowed, would succeed where the previous ones had failed. ''Everything is going as we want it now,'' he said.<br><br>Other Sphinx lovers are crossing their fingers. ''Face is more important than fact in this country,'' said a foreign archaeologist who has worked for many years in Egypt. ''Everything becomes personalized and politicized. A piece of the Sphinx falls, the chickens start flapping their wings, the feathers fly and a whole new Sphinx is created without the advice of a single art historian.''<br><br>He regarded the inclusion of foreign experts in the new campaign as encouraging - the previous work was exclusively Egyptian - but warned that it could also be a future source of political controversy. While hundreds of Egyptians have become students of their past in recent decades, foreigners continue to dominate Egyptology, which was, after all, a foreign invention. The first Egyptologists were scientists who accompanied Napoleon on the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. They were followed by scores of others who ranged from dedicated scholars to treasure hunters and plunderers.<br><br>Mindful of their checkered past, foreign archaeologists working in Egypt today are careful not to criticize local colleagues on the record or to assume too high a profile for their discoveries.<br><br>Two years ago, when a British-Dutch expedition uncovered a tomb that a British reporter inaccurately described as ''the most important'' since the Englishman Howard Carter opened the tomb of Tutankhamen in 1922, Egyptian authorities bristled and a columnist in the government-owned magazine Al Mussawar wrote a diatribe against foreign archaeological missions which, he charged, ''have spread like a cancer over the land of Egypt.'' Ahmed Kadry, now criticized for failing to use foreign help to restore the Sphinx, was previously attacked for allowing foreigners to test new theories and equipment - for example, letting two French architects drill several small holes in the Great Pyramid of Cheops.<br><br>''The problem is that some countries are extremely rich in terms of cultural heritage but not so rich in economic and technical resources,'' said Luis Monreal, director of the California-based Getty Conservation Institute, which is restoring the 3,200-year-old tomb of Nefertari in upper Egypt, another project started under Kadry's administration.<br><br>''There are probably no more than 5,000 properly trained conservators in the world,'' Monreal added. ''That's as though you had one bed for 10-million sick people. The great dilemma for the 21st century is that all this heritage cannot be preserved.''"

    "text": "China and the United States announced a historic accord Tuesday to reduce arms sales to Taiwan, but Peking swiftly warned the arms dispute still 'clouds' Sino-U.S. relations and could provoke a crisis unless sales end entirely.<br><br>'The agreement reached between the governments of China and the United States on the question of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan marks only a beginning of the settlement of this issue,' a statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry said within minutes of the announcement.<br><br>'It is evident that failure to settle this issue is bound to seriously impair relations between the two countries.' The agreement, announced simultaneously in Washington and Peking, pledged Washington would gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan, which Peking considers a renegade province. China also pledged its moves to reunify the island with the mainland would be peaceful.<br><br>Hours before the communique was made public, diplomatic sources said, U.S Ambassador Arthur Hummel Jr. met with Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping, China's most powerful leader.<br><br>But almost immediately, there were signs of a possible disagreement over language that said the United States 'intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution.'<br><br>American officials indicated they believed that meant Taiwan would continue being supplied until it is peacefully reunified with China. But a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the 'final resolution referred to here certainly implies that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan must be completely terminated over a period of time.'<br><br>Diplomatic sources said the Chinese were clearly pleased with the outcome of 10 months of difficult and secret negotiations. And the swift Foreign Ministry warning and an equally tough editorial by the Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily, were seen as attempts to make the compromises more palatable to party hardliners. Explaining why China dropped its demand for an immediate, total cutoff of arms to Taiwan, a foreign ministry official borrowed a phrase from former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger -- saying China realized the dispute was so difficult it had to be solved by 'step-by-step' diplomacy.<br><br>The People's Daily editorial warned the communique was only a first step.<br><br>'The clouds hanging over Sino-U.S. relations have not been completely cleared away,' it said. 'The United States has made several promises but what it will actually do in the future remains to be seen.'<br><br>Officials would not say if Deng personally participated in the negotiations that led to the accord, but diplomatic sources said the Chinese were represented at 'the highest-level.'<br><br>Western diplomats saw the agreement as a gain for Deng, who evidently managed to neutralize opposition to the accord at secret leadership meetings held two weeks ago to prepare for a Communist Party congress opening Sept. 1.<br><br>The congress, the first in five years, is expected to rubber stamp Deng's modernization reforms, his renovation of the party power structure and his choice of younger leaders to fill posts occupied by aging cadres.<br><br>While all the important decisions have already been made, failure to resolve the Taiwan dispute before the party congress could have been used against Deng by hardliners opposed to his reforms, diplomats said."

    "text": "ALGIERS, Algeria - The Palestinian leadership has decided to abide by majority rule and will endorse a key United Nations resolution recognizing Israel's right to exist, Palestinian officials said Sunday.<br><br>The officials said the leaders of all main factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), with the exception of the hard-line Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), had agreed on this step. The leaders were nearing a compromise on the final wording of a political statement to be issued this week along with a declaration of an independent Palestinian state.<br><br>The political statement, officials said, will call for an international Middle East peace conference on the basis of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242. The resolution, passed after the 1967 Middle East War, asks Israel to give up territory captured in that war in return for a guarantee of its right to exist within secure borders.<br><br>The statement will also ask for a guarantee of a Palestinian right to statehood, which was not mentioned in Resolution 242. Officials acknowledged that the language will not fully satisfy the longstanding U.S. position, which opposes an independent Palestinian state and rejects many U.N. resolutions as virulently anti-Israel.<br><br>But they said they hoped the statement would go far enough to sway Western public opinion and persuade the administration of President-elect George Bush to adopt a more sympathetic policy toward the Palestinian cause.<br><br>''I think the United States will find that many of its conditions have been met,'' said Jamil Hilal, the official spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).<br><br>On Sunday night, the Democratic Front leader, Nayef Hawatmeh, said that some differences continued over whether the political statement should mention by number U.N. resolutions that guarantee the right of Palestinians displaced in four Middle East conflicts to return to their homes or receive compensation. But the Democratic Front seemed ready to reach a compromise with the largest PLO faction, the Fatah group of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. George Habash, chief of the Popular Front, was alone among the leaders in refusing to give up his resistance to mention Resolution 242. But he agreed not to walk out of the conference or splinter the Palestinian movement, PLO officials said. Instead, he is expected to enter his reservations on the record and allow the Palestine National Council (PNC), an informal parliament, to proceed on the basis of majority rule. ''Habash told the PNC that he would not give Israel the gift of splitting the PLO over 242,'' a PLO official said.<br><br>The political statement is also expected to renounce acts of terrorism and to endorse the so-called Cairo Declaration issued by Arafat in November 1985. That declaration was made in the aftermath of the hijacking of an Italian cruise ship, the Achille Lauro, and the murder of an elderly American passenger. It states that the PLO would confine future acts of violence to military targets within Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank of Jordan and Gaza Strip. In recent years, Arafat has personally endorsed Resolution 242 coupled with Palestinian self-determination. But the PNC - which includes representatives of the main PLO factions as well as Palestinian communities outside Israel - has never done so.<br><br>''This PNC will legislate the line that has been presented by Chairman Arafat since a very long time,'' said Bassam Abusherif, a top adviser to Arafat. ''The line calling for a just peace in the Middle East.''<br><br>Some PLO moderates expressed disappointment that acceptance of 242 is likely to be muddied by the Palestinian leadership's decision to refer to other U.N. resolutions in its statement. But they stressed that it isstill a watershed for a movement that at its founding in 1964 was dedicated to the disappearance of the Jewish state.<br><br>The declaration of independence, they added, is meant to boost morale of the 1.7-million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who for nearly a year have been fighting Israeli military occupation with little more than sticks and stones.<br><br>It is this intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic, that has done more than any PNC declaration or PLO manifesto to increase popular sympathy for the Palestinians and to revive interest by Western governments in pursuing a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict."

    "text": "Ronald Reagan's sweeping election victory plunged the world into political reappraisal Wednesday and the initial reaction was guarded, reflecting concern over some of his campaign promises and doubts about his foreign policy expertise.<br><br>China made no secret of its disppointment, the Soviets sent mixed signals and a warning on SALT and Iran said it would not affect the hostage crisis. While major allies withheld official comment beyond pro forma congratulations to the president-elect, privately their reactions were mixed and tinged with doubts over whether America becomes more or less isolationist under GOP stewardship.<br><br>The only nations openly greeting Reagan's election with relief were rightists in Latin America and Asia, whose regimes have been sweating under the heat of President Carter's human rights campaign.<br><br>In Western Europe, hopes that Reagan will infuse a new sense of leadership into the flagging alliance were tempered by fears that he understands little of East-West and economic issues and is not predisposed toward detente.<br><br>In the Middle East, both Israeli and Arab officials saw Reagan's victory as being to Israel's advantage. Camp David was Carter's biggest foreign policy triumph and Egyptians asked whether Reagan would have the same interest in continuing the process.<br><br>The Soviet Union hinted it could react either way in a commentary pledging to pursue 'good relations' with Washington, but stressing the extent to which this depends on ratification of the SALT II treaty criticized by Reagan.<br><br>Analysts also noted Reagan's election may not be unwelcomed by the deeply conservative Soviet leadership, which seems to prefer conservative American presidents. For them, President Carter was an unreliable partner, Richard Nixon was not.<br><br>Among America's NATO allies, whose governments are preoccupied by security issues, politicians found themselves caught between a desire to see a stronger America capable of checking Soviet ambitions and their fears of a return to confrontation politics. The French reaction typified this ambivalence.<br><br>Michel Poniatowski, a close adviser to President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said he felt 'a reaction of relief.' The United States, he said, 'lost these last few years a great deal of its power, bringing about an increasing imbalance to the detriment of the United States vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.'<br><br>But another senior French official said bluntly: 'Reagan understands nothing.'<br><br>Specific nations faced with major problems that at one time or another became issues in the campaign all tried to assess what a Reagan presidency will mean for them.<br><br>Iran said it would not affect the ordeal of America's 52 hostages, held for 368 days. 'The conditions for the release of the hostages are unchanged. For us it makes no difference who governs the USA,' said Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai.<br><br>China, which bitterly criticized Reagan's campaign promise to restore official links with Taiwan, skipped over even pro forma congratulations in a frosty communique that bluntly warned him against harming Sino- American relations.<br><br>Nationalist Chinese officials on Tawain, by contrast, were so elated they broke with tradition by commenting on an American election for the first time since 1949. 'We are gratified to learn that Mr. Reagan has beenelected and this is the expression of U.S. public opinion,' a statement said.<br><br>Other warm messages of support came from South Korea and Haiti, both ruled by right-wing regimes, and from rightists in Guatemala and El Salvador, where Reagan's victory set off a night-long celebration of shooting.<br><br>'Reagan's election will intimidate the leftist subversives. They are spoiled children and now they have someone to spank them,' said a spokesman for El Salvador's far-right Broad National Front.<br><br>In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states issued non-committal statements while the Palestine Libertion Organization said, 'the curse of the Palestinian people' fell upon Carter as it does 'all those who plot against its just cause and inalienable rights.'<br><br>Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat both expressed interest in meeting Reagan as soon as possible -- Begin when he is in the United States next week on a private visit.<br><br>Sadat continued to press for a three-way summit with Begin and Reagan and Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali said he hoped to go to Washington next month to work out the details with the president-elect.<br><br>It was also Sadat who, of all America's allies, praised President Carter the most eloquently.<br><br>'Peace upon Carter the day he was elected,' the Egyptian president said.

    "text": "TRIPOLI, Libya - The back of what used to be the French Embassy in Tripoli is still missing its windows. Rusty metal rods protrude from the crumbling side of a villa next door, chunks of concrete hanging from some of them like rotten fruit.<br><br>Nearly three years after the United States and Libya last came to blows, the wounds of that confrontation are still glaringly and deliberately apparent in Bin Ashur, an upper-middle class neighborhood accidentally hit when the United States bombed Tripoli in the middle of the night of April 15, 1986.<br><br>''I guess the government wants the people to remember,'' said Abdul Razak Tonnelli, an 18-year-old student who lives across the street from the ruins. ''Now the Americans may hit again,'' he said. ''It's a big problem.''<br><br>Some Libyans, remembering the night the U.S. F-111s roared in from the sea to avenge Libyan involvement in a terrorist bombing in Berlin, have left the capital for second homes in the countryside or to visit relatives in other cities. The Bab al-Aziziya barracks of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, where the wreckage of his residence, purposely hit in 1986, also remains unrepaired, has reportedly been further fortified in case the Americans try again to kill the Libyan leader.<br><br>Reporters touring the city Friday saw extra troops posted around the barracks and warplanes on alert on a side runway of Tripoli's international airport. Gadhafi himself has kept out of public view since Wednesday.<br><br>But the mood in the seaside capital, while hardly cheery, was far from panicked. Tripoli was not deserted and its inhabitants, compared to the lead-up to the 1986 bombing, seemed comparatively relaxed.<br><br>''There's some underlying tension but nothing like 1986,'' said a European diplomat. ''Security forces have been put on alert, and some reserves were called back to the barracks.'' On Friday, the weekly holiday in Moslem countries, young men lounged at snack bars tucked into peeling Italianate buildings along the colonnaded boulevards built here by Libya's former colonial rulers. Some of them were reading the latest issue of the major government daily, Al Jamahiriya, which ran a front-page cartoon showing President Reagan with a bomb in his hand.<br><br>Just off the city's central Green Square, where Gadhafi likes to address his people, a flea market he allowed to open six months ago was crowded with Libyans and East Europeans and Filipino migrant workers. ''No, I'm not frightened,'' said a Moroccan peddler who was selling Turkish blue jeans for $30 a pair. ''Besides, business is too good.''<br><br>Should the United States attack, the presumed target this time would not be Tripoli itself, but a factory at the desert town of Rabta 40 miles south of the city that Washington says is potentially the biggest producer of chemical weapons in the Third World.<br><br>The Libyans deny this and say the plant is in fact intended to produce medicine. Libyan doctors and nurses and members of the local ''Peoples Congress'' have been sitting in at the factory, according to the Libyan news agency, JANA, to protest the American threat to destroy the plant.<br><br>To bolster its claims that the plant is harmless, Libya promised to show the facility to foreign journalists who descended on Tripoli over the past three days.<br><br>But instead of the plant at Rabta, two busloads of reporters, who were not told their destination until they had traveled more than an hour from Tripoli, were taken to the Roman ruins at Leptis Magna for a bit of sightseeing. They were kept out of the capital until after dark.Appearing later before a crowd of angry reporters in Tripoli's Grand Hotel, Libyan Information Minister Rajad Abu Dabous promised a tour of the plant today. ''We are innocent. It is a pharmaceutical plant and nothing more,'' he said. He added, however, that ''nothing in international law prevents a country from setting up a plant to produce whatever it wants.''<br><br>As in past confrontations, the Libyans are portraying themselves as the victims of American aggression following the loss of two of their warplanes in a dogfight Wednesday over the Mediterranean.<br><br>But while Gadhafi has vowed to ''meet challenge with challenge,'' his government has sought to keep the conflict from escalating.<br><br>Instead of threatening to send ''suicide squads'' to assassinate Americans, as the Libyans did in 1986, they have appealed for diplomatic support from fellow Arabs and at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council.<br><br>There has not been a public funeral for the two pilots the Libyans have privately admitted were killed in Wednesday's dogfight. The government also has not disputed that the clash took place over international waters, although officials maintain that the two Libyan MiG-23s were on a ''routine reconnaissance mission'' when they were attacked by what they claimed were more than a dozen F-14 jets and shot down without provocation. The United States says only two American planes were involved.<br><br>''The Libyans are genuinely afraid that the Americans are going to go after wider targets, and they want to defuse the situation,'' the European diplomat said. The diplomat, who attributed the dogfight to carelessness or bravado on the part of the Libyan pilots, noted that Gadhafi has tried hard in the past year to repair his image as a reckless adventurer.<br><br>''He's being careful not to damage his image again,'' the diplomat said.<br><br>In Bin Ashur, however, it is the U.S. image that seems to need repairing. The student, standing on a weedy knoll covering what had been a bomb crater, said the Untied States was not really interested in destroying the chemical factory but really wanted instead ''to hit the Libyan government.''<br><br>Asked why the United States would want to do this, he said, ''because they are imperialists.''"

    "text": "To educated Arabs, it has long been a cause for sad irony that their region, which spawned the world's first great civilizations, is today so far behind the West in political development.<br><br>Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Iraq's predecessor, gave rise to organized agriculture, writing and even the first monotheistic religion, worship of the sun god Akhenaton in Egypt. The Middle East also produced the three great religions that persist today - Judaism, Christianity and Islam. During the Middle Ages, when Europeans were little better than barbarians, high culture flourished under Moslem dynasties, and cities such as Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad were like today's Paris, New York and Tokyo rolled into one. Arab scholars, fluent in Greek, in which the wisdom of the ancients had been preserved, developed and eventually passed on this knowledge to Europe, raising the curtain on the Dark Ages and inspiring the European Renaissance.<br><br>So why did the Middle East fall behind the West and why has it failed to catch up? Arab leaders put a large part of the blame on outside forces, a tendency that despite its considerable validity has made it more difficult for them to recognize their own failings and do something about them.<br><br>The beginning of the Middle East's comparative downfall dates to the Ottoman Turks, who reunified the region in the 16th century but who succumbed to decadence and lost their military edge.<br><br>Napoleon's French infantrymen, employing the height of contemporary military science, stunned the Turkish horsemen defending Egypt at the turn of the 18th century and only withdrew when defeated in a celebrated naval battle by the other European superpower of the time, Britain.<br><br>From the late 1800s through much of this century, the British and the French largely partitioned the Arab world, influencing it through alliances, outright colonization or so-called mandates. Only in the period between the two world wars did Arab nations begin to gain independence on paper. But the boundaries were drawn by foreigners - Jordan, it is said, was created by Winston Churchill one day over breakfast - and the sense of nationhood has remained fragile particularly in the countries sitting atop the vast oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.<br><br>Ruled in essence by one extended family, the Sabahs, from 1756 until the Iraqi invasion last week, Kuwait has had formal independence only since 1961.<br><br>The fluid nature of boundaries in the sands of the Arabian peninsula tempted Iraq to contest Kuwaiti claims at that time. The Iraqis backed off when Britain deployed troops. But Iraq and Kuwait never reached a formal agreement on their border. The Iraqi strongman, Saddam Hussein, has long coveted two islands at the top of the Persian Gulf as well as Kuwait's oil reserves.<br><br>While outsiders can be blamed for drawing artificial boundaries, many of the governments within those boundaries have so far failed to instill a strong sense of national identity among their populations. This has been particularly true in the Persian Gulf states, where natives are sometimes in the minority and most of the work is done by Palestinians, Pakistanis and Filipinos who lack rights of citizenship.<br><br>Even for the natives, there is no democracy as such but an archaic system of tribal consultation and patronage in the case of the rich oil states, and of dictatorship or fake parliamentary democracy almost everywhere else. \"\"The immense havoc Saddam could wreak derives from the fragility of the whole Middle Eastern interstate system to which he has just dealt such a stunning blow, from the degeneracy of most of its regimes and the despair and disillusionment of its people,'' wrote David Hirst, an expert on the region and longtime correspondent for the Guardian newspaper. It is impossible to foretell what effect Iraq's aggression - the first outright invasion of one Arab state by another in modern times ill have on the region as a whole or on such complex disputes as the Arab-Israeli conflict. But if it disabuses Arabs of the notion that the rest of the world is to blame for their failings and of the vain hope that one day an Arab leader will come along to unify and save them, then it may do the Middle East a service in the long run."

By anarchism, I mean people who don't observe the relevant regulations and discipline, people who don't like to work and alcoholics.'<br><br>Although a guerrilla-style underground does not appear to exist, reporters encountered much evidence of widespread anti-Chinese feeling and of a loose but effective network of dissidents who appear to have links with the Dalai Lama's organization in Dharmsala, India, 900 miles away.<br><br>This network is held together by two sentiments: reverence for the Dalai Lama, who the majority of Tibetans still believe is their only rightful ruler, and hatred of the Chinese, who invaded in 1950 to enforce a claim that dates back to the 7th century when King Srongsten Gampo took a Chinese princess as one of his three wives.<br><br>Far from being eliminated by the systematic destruction of more than 2,000 monasteries during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Tibetan Buddhism seems only to have been tempered by previous Chinese attempts toeradicate it.<br><br>Signs of reverence for the Dalai Lama and hatred of the Chinese are everywhere.<br><br>Most Tibetans wear silver or brass amulets, carry prayer wheels and have pictures of the Dalai Lama to show their devotion to Buddhism and the spiritual leader they revere as a living God-King.<br><br>Pilgrims walk clockwise around the Jokhang, the most important temple in Tibet, singing sutras and spinning prayer wheels. The devout prostrate themselves for hours in front of the golden-roofed temple, chanting the holy words 'Om Mani Padme Hum,' (Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus). During strolls, reporters were approached constantly by Tibetans seeking to pass on secret appeals or whisper words of discontent.<br><br>'The Chinese do not belong here. We support the Dalai Lama,' one middle-aged woman whispered. Another woman conceded to reporters that China's Deng Xiaoping was 'the leader of our country.' But asked who was higher, Deng or the Dalai Lama, she replied without hesitation: 'the Dalai Lama.'<br><br>China has tried to calm feelings of separatism by reducing its presence in Tibet over the past two years, removing as many as 20,000 Chinese civilians.<br><br>But the Chinese realize that the Dalai Lama's exile remains a continuing symbol of separatist feelings and have invited him to return as spiritual leader -- provided he follows China's political line.<br><br>The 49-year-old Dalai Lama has sent five fact-finding missions to Tibet and has said he could return only if he was convinced most Tibetans were happy under Chinese rule.<br><br>Said a Tibetan monk: 'If the Dalai Lama says he will come back only if Tibetans are happy under the Chinese, then the Dalai Lama is never coming back.'

    "text": "Singing to himself helps Jin Miaolin take his mind off work. 'It cheers me up,' said Jin, who spends most of his time bent over dead bodies.<br><br>Jin is a make-up artist -- but not for the living. He works at the Longhua state crematorium, preparing the faces of the dead for their funerals. In his spare time, Jin is a popular composer. Two of his songs have become nationwide hits in China. Jin, 35, credits his pressures at work with giving him the inspiration to write songs.<br><br>'I've seen so much sadness in my job that it has given me the feeling I should write happy songs,' Jin said in a recent interview at his place of work.<br><br>Jin began composing 10 years ago and more than 80 of his songs have been recorded since then. But his big break came in 1980, when 'Postgirl,' his most popular tune, was broadcast on the radio and quickly sold out in the stores. That was followed by another hit, 'Happy Young People,' in 1981.<br><br>Popular music in China -- that is, music that is officially encouraged to be popular -- tends to be a mixture of clumsy morality and ideological mush with no sex and a heavy emphasis on the virtues of clean socialist living. It is not exactly the stuff that Michael Jackson hits are made of; more like the philosophy of Karl Marx as sung by Pat Boone.<br><br>Jin's music is no exception. 'Postgirl' is a snappy little tune about a female letter-carrier who loves her work and sings about how determined she is to be successful. 'Happy Young People' is full of la-la-las and explains 'why Chinese youth are so happy,' Jin said. Some sample lyrics:<br><br>'...Why am I so happy?<br><br>'Because I love the colorful life. 'I am like a lark in spring, flying into blue skies.<br><br>'I love the ordinary work.'<br><br>'The song is about myself,' Jin said. 'I am doing very ordinary work, but I still find that life is very meaningful.'<br><br>While most of Jin's tunes are upbeat, he has written a few sadder songs such as 'People Who Work in Special Places,' a bittersweet ballad about crematorium workers.<br><br>Despite his success as a composer, Jin says he has no plans to quit the crematorium, where he has worked for the past eight years, to devote all his time to music.<br><br>For one thing, composers don't get paid much in China. Jin gets between $2 and $10 for each song bought by a publisher. For another, as the song says, 'I have learned to love my work,' Jin said.<br><br>That wasn't true in the beginning, however. The first time Jin found himself alone in a room with dead bodies, he froze and had to be rescued by a fellow worker. Single then, Jin also had trouble meeting girls. Dates tended to end as soon as the girl asked him where he worked. Eventually, Jin met someone 'who came to understand the value of my work.' They married in 1980 and nowhave a baby daughter.<br><br>Jin also credits his music with helping him to overcome his fear of working with the dead.<br><br>'When I work I play music in my mind,' he said. 'I do make-up with a musical rhythm.' "

    "text": "What looks like a lobster dressed in a morning coat, has a sweet tooth for skyscrapers and is named after a popular French singer?<br><br>Any Japanese kid would know the answer but, for the benefit of other readers, the answer is Barutan -- perhaps the most infamous of the current crop of creatures crawling through Japanese monster movies these days. Fans of Godzilla and other low-budget Japanese monster movies - which developed a cult following outside Japan for being so bad they were good -- can take heart. The Japanese monster movie industry is alive and well and just as bad as ever, if not worse.<br><br>What's more, those flesh-eating, fire-breathing, cement-crushing crustaceans may soon be crawling abroad again.<br><br>A Tokyo movie company is about to start filming the first Godzilla movie in nearly 15 years and an affiliate is trying to interest U.S. distributors in a specially-made version of Ultraman, currently the most popular monster movie series in Japan.<br><br>Ultraman and his five beady-eyed, metallic brothers live on the planet M-78 and commute to work on Earth whenever their help is needed in battling the likes of Barutan, Garamon, Mottokureron or the vile Woo, which looks like an abominable snowman with a bad case of overbite.<br><br>This they do with a mixture of flashy karate chops, death-defying leaps and bounds and lots of red, green and yellow smoke that keeps millions of Japanese kids glued to their television sets for 30 minutes most every afternoon.<br><br>Arrayed against them are a gallery of more than 750 fanged, horned and scaly beasts that creep, crawl or crush their way across the urban landscape and seem, for the most part, to be named after foreigners. Barutan, for instance, is named after the way Japanese pronounce French singer Sylvie Vartan's name.<br><br>Ultraman, which celebrates its 20th anniversary next year, is the longest-running TV and movie series in Japan and has spawned a multimillion-dollar spinoff industry in the form of T-shirts, dolls, costumes, records and comic books.<br><br>'Ultraman has had a tremendous social impact in Japan,' says Noboru Tsuburaya, president of the film company that bears his name and was founded by his father, Ultraman's creator.<br><br>'The first generation of kids to watch Ultraman has grown up and now has kids of its own. So Ultraman gives families a basis for communication. Parents can talk to their children about the monsters because they saw the same monsters 20 years ago,' Tsuburaya said. Critics of the genre, including some of the American companies Tsuburaya is trying to interest in Ultraman, say that is precisely the trouble with Japanese monster movies -- the same old monsters, the same old plots and, unfortunately, the same old level of technique.<br><br>Tsuburaya admits that Ultraman's special effects may not be up to the level of 'Star Wars,' 'E.T.' or 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' But he notes that American filmmakers 'spend a lot more time and money' creating such effects and says that if 'we Japanese do the same, we can produce films on the same level.' That they have not done so yet says less about the technical ability of the Japanese film industry than it does about these films' time-tested formula for success and their function as vehicles for the communication of cultural values and mores.For one thing, unlike their American counterparts, Japanese supermen are not individuals, lone crusaders for truth, justice and the Japanese way. Ultraman, Bioman, Dynaman and other Japanese super-heroes work in teams, as members of family groups, teaching youngsters early lessons about the importance of cooperation and conformity in an intensely group- oriented society.<br><br>The individual is the monster -- he who opposes the interests of the group and tries to destroy the social order.

The report did not specify how they were executed, but death by firing squad is the usual method in China.<br><br>Waving knives and dynamite, the five hijackers had tried to commandeer a Soviet-built, Ilyushin-18 turboprop during a domestic flight from Xian in north-central China to the coastal port of Shanghai July 25. They were identified as Sun Yunping, Yan Feng, Gao Keli, Zie Zhimin and Wei Xueli, all in their 20s.<br><br>Overpowered and beaten by passengers and crew, there was no word on the hijackers' fate until Xinhua announced the execution, adding that they had been tried in Shanghai Aug. 10-11. Later Thursday, evening television news showed a film of the hijackers, dressed in blue prison clothes, listening grimly as the judge read their sentence.<br><br>The film dispelled rumors that one or more of the hijackers had been killed by the angry crew and passengers who had beaten them with brooms, bottles and mops as the plane dived from the skies.<br><br>The hijacking attempt was disclosed by China because 19 American tourists were among the 80 passengers aboard. None was injured despite one of the hijackers exploding a stick of dynamite in the plane's bathroom during the melee. The plane's crew and 13 passengers who helped were honored in Peking Thursday by China's CAAC state airline, Xinhua said.<br><br>As 1,200 officials gave them 'thunderous applause,' the crew received certificates, monetary rewards and red silk banners emblazoned with the words 'Heroic CAAC Crew' in gold letters.<br><br>Accepting his award, the pilot, Capt.

About half the worshippers at the Nantang and Chongwenmen services appeared to be people under 30 and many were in their teens. Protestant officials estimate 1,500 people -- a third of them under 30 -- regularly attend four weekly services in Peking. While numbers are hard to come by, there are an estimated 4 million Catholics and 1 million Protestants now worshipping publicly in China -- slightly more than before the Communist Revolution in 1949. Persecuted during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, China's Christians were forced to go underground while churches were looted and turned into government warehouses and priests were sent off to factories, farms and prison camps.<br><br>China's current leadership eased restrictions on religion in the mid 1970s and it has been allowed to re- blossom, but on a limited scale.<br><br>The Chingwenmen church, a Methodist house of worship until it was annexed to a neighboring middle school in 1958, was returned to the Protestants last July and inaugurated Christmas Eve with a two-hour service.<br><br>Renovation of the octagonal church, built in 1903, continued until the last minute as workers toiled around the clock the day before to whitewash the walls that still smelled of fresh paint and piece together hundreds of old radiator parts that in the end did not work.<br><br>Down dark alleys, on foot and on bikes, Chinese began converging on the new church a few hours after nightfall. An old man hobbled in with the help of two grandaughters, followed by a slim youth in a black imitation leather jacket and carrying a red crash helmet in one hand and a Bible in the other. Another old man with sallow cheeks and hands as rough as bark groped in a plastic bag, extracting first a Bible, then a pair of ragged orange mittens and finally a tattered song book for his granddaughter to join in a chorus of 'Silent Night,' whose words he knew by heart.<br><br>When the service ended, he carefully packed his belongings back into the bag, pulled down the peek of his blue Mao cap and followed his grandaughter's lead to the door.<br><br>For a moment he hesitated. Then he turned to the foreigner standing next to him and said, 'Merry Christmas,' before hobbling out into the night. "

    "title": "Despite new leader, Iran power struggle is far from over",
    "text": "The appointment of President Ali Khamenei as the successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is a victory for pragmatists seeking to ease Iran's international isolation, but a power struggle in that chaotic country is far from over, according to experts on Iran.<br><br>The analysts interpret the naming of Khamenei, 49, as a step engineered by Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Parliament speaker and a leading contender for power in post-Khomeini Iran. An 83-member Assembly of Experts gave Khamenei the promotion one day after Khomeini's death.<br><br>''It's a good thing and the first victory for Rafsanjani after Khomeini's death,'' said Fahmy Huweidy, an Egyptian writer on Islam who recently visited Iran. ''For those of us outside Iran, it is also positive. But the power struggle will go on at least until presidential elections in August.''<br><br>Khamenei himself told Tehran television that his leadership is temporary, pending a review of the constitution that was ordered by Khomeini shortly before his death.<br><br>The review is to be completed before the presidential elections in which Khamenei, a two-term president, cannot run again. ''The power struggle will intensify and become more open,'' said a Western diplomat based in a Persian Gulf country. ''Under Khomeini, there were always disagreements but there was also a certain cohesiveness. With the death of Khomeini, Iran has lost its anchor and stabilizer.''<br><br>In recent months, though, the ailing Khomeini had not seemed much of a stabilizer.<br><br>For a short while after Iran's grudging acceptance last summer of a cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iraq, the country that had previously branded foreign powers as ''greater or lesser satans'' presented a more conciliatory face to the world and solicited Western participation in its postwar reconstruction.<br><br>But in February came an about-face. The glowering ayatollah called for Moslems to execute British author Salman Rushdie for writing a book deemed to blaspheme Islam. European governments recoiled and downgraded relations, and Iranian officials who had sought to build bridges to the West were purged.<br><br>In March, Khomeini deepened Iran's internal political confusion by firing his designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri. Montazeri had apparently offended Khomeini by criticizing the failings of the 10-year- old Islamic revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed shah of Iran.<br><br>The next month, the Iranian leader took a potential step toward resolving the power struggle. He appointed a committee to revise Iran's constitution in advance of the August presidential elections. The only announced candidate in those elections is Rafsanjani, a wily survivor of the revolution's many twists and turns. With substantial backing from parliament, he is seeking to revise the constitution to strengthen the office of president by abolishing the post of prime minister, currently held by hard-liner Hussein Musavi. But besides Musavi, Rafsanjani, who is considered a pragmatist despite his recent echoing of Tehran's latest anti-Western line, has other hard-line rivals: the interior minister, Ali Akbar Montashemi; Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, chairman of the Council of Experts; and Ahmed Khomeini, the late Iranian leader's son.In recent months, Ahmed Khomeini assumed a high profile and functioned almost as his father's stand-in. But he lacks a formal government position.<br><br>''Ahmed has neither the religious credentials nor the administrative experience to rule, and it's not clear whether claiming dynastic credentials will be enough,'' said Shahram Chubin, an scholar on Iran at the Institute of International Studies in Geneva.<br><br>''The appointment of Khamenei is a bad sign for Ahmed,'' added Huweidy, the Egyptian writer. He called the choice surprising because Khamenei, like Rafsanjani, is only a hojatoislam, a lesser rank of cleric than ayatollah. He said it was still possible that a council of three or five clerics would be named to perform Khomeini's religious functions.<br><br>Analysts said no one man could or would take Khomeini's place since the ayatollah was both Iran's supreme religious and temporal authority.<br><br>Also uncertain is the effect Khomeini's death will have on Iran's frayed relations with other countries.<br><br>While Iranian leaders may be ''too busy among themselves to start new mischief abroad, they are also unlikely to make conciliatory gestures toward the West or the Arabs,'' one Egyptian military expert said.<br><br>Until the domestic power struggle is resolved, the United Nations-sponsored talks on turning last summer's cease-fire into a peace treaty with Iraq are likely to remain stalled.<br><br>And Westerners held hostage for years by Iranian-backed factions in Beirut will probably remain captives. Egyptian and Western experts said they doubted that Iraq, which started the gulf war by invading Iran in 1980, would mount any aggressive military actions to take advantage of the current interregnum in Iran.<br><br>''The Iraqis will not try again,'' said the Egyptian military expert. ''They learned their lesson.'' However, Iranian leftist opposition groups based in Iraq vowed to step up their struggle against the Tehran regime. The death of Khomeini should further diminish Iran's attraction as a model for other would-be Islamic revolutionaries, already demoralized by Iran's bloody post-revolutionary record and its failure to defeat Iraq in the gulf war.<br><br>When he seized power in 1979, Khomeini promised to build the first authentic Islamic government the world had seen since the origins of the religion in the Arabian desert 1,300 years ago.<br><br>But he leaves behind a country ruined by a war that he prolonged - in a vain bid for vengeance against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein - and a leadership still divided over how to translate medieval Islamic precepts into a coherent program for modern government. Attempted reforms in industry, agriculture and labor relations have been stymied by disagreements between conservative clerics who favor private enterprise and militants who support state ownership. Even laws imposing Islamic dress on women and banning alcohol and Western music have had only superficial success.<br><br>Besides 1-million war casualties, the repeated waves of executions of thousands of political dissidents, drug dealers and other alleged criminals without any semblance of due process have horrified many Iranians. Since the revolution, more than 2-million of the country's 50-million people have fled, many of them professionals urgently needed for Iran's development. Iranian attempts to export the revolution have also largely failed, except in even more troubled Lebanon.<br><br>In Beirut, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the Hezbollah or ''Party of God'' that is believed to be holding Western hostages, told his supporters Sunday: ''We may face a difficult period ... but even though he (Khomeini) has left us, he has left a part of himself ... in each one of us. We are all Khomeinis after his death.''"

But others in her profession are not so well off. Belly dancing has had its ups and downs, but rarely have times been as tough as they are now.<br><br>The resurgence in recent years of Muslim fundamentalism has reduced sharply the number of places in the Middle East where belly dancers can perform.<br><br>\"I came to Egypt because it is the centre of belly dancing - it is where you have to prove yourself,\" says Lisa Loevenguth, from New York. \"But I have been disappointed. Belly dancers here are treated like criminals.\"<br><br>Belly dancers are not being paid as well, either, because of increased competition for jobs in a shrinking market.<br><br>The Gulf countries, with the exception of the United Arab Emirates, have banned belly dancing. Lebanon used to be one of the main centres for belly dancing but only the bravest of the brave would work there now. Syria and Iraq still have belly dancing, but neither has the night life or the culture to qualify as a mecca for the dance. That leaves Egypt and even here the outlook is far from bright.<br><br>Last February, when police conscripts took to the streets to complain about being underpaid, they were joined by Muslim fundamentalists and burnt down several hotels and more than a dozen nightclubs.<br><br>A big drop in tourism, the result of Middle East terrorism, and domestic disturbances like the police riots, has forced the large hotels and nightclubs to cut back on entertainment.<br><br>According to Medhat Hawary, a businessman and belly dance aficionado: \"It's not like it used to be. Before, if a belly dancer with a name was dancing, people would come every night to see her.<br><br>\"But now ... people don't go out any more. It's the economy, mostly. But also people are afraid of the fundamentalists.\"<br><br>A big name dancer like Fifi Abdu earns about $A2,250 a show, and may perform several times a night. But the overheads are high. The dancer must pay her musicians - small-time dancers often have 30-piece bands - and costumes can cost thousands of dollars.<br><br>Some dancers complain that ever-tightening government restrictions also crimp their styles. Belly dancers in Egypt must wear body stockings now when they perform, and many have been forced to tone down their acts. \"It is ridiculous,\" Sahar Hamdi, another famous dancer, says. \"First they interfered with the way we dress, now with the way we dance. They won't let me be sexy any more. A belly dancer must be sexy. It is the nature of the dance. "

    "text": "CAIRO - Egypt's latest archaeological expedition will be a success even if it comes up with nothing more than thin air.<br><br>Air, the older the better, is in fact a prime target of the project to penetrate a pit at the foot of the Pyramid of Cheops that scientists hope has remained sealed for thousands of years.<br><br>Believed to have been dug 4,600 years ago at the time of the Pharaoh Cheops, the pit was one of two discovered in 1952 by a young Egyptologist named Kamal el-Mallakh, who was clearing rubble from the site of earlier excavations. Two years later, Mallakh received permission for his own excavation. He chiseled a hole through one of the limestone blocks covering one of pits and found the intact pieces of an ancient boat - a graceful funerary bark of Lebanese cedar that may have been intended to carry Cheops' spirit on a mythic journey through the heavens. The find was acclaimed at the time as the most marvelous since the discovery of the tomb of King Tutankhamun by the Englishman Howard Carter, and Mallakh later described his sensations in Carteresque terms.<br><br>''I closed my eyes. And then . . . I smelt incense, a very holy, holy, holy smell. I smelt time . . . I smelt centuries . . . I smelt history.''<br><br>Thrilling as it was, Mallakh's olfactory experience is something the latest expedition doesn't want to repeat.<br><br>While team members would be delighted to discover a second boat, they aim to explore the second pit without allowing one whiff of its atmosphere to escape - or modern pollution to flow in.<br><br>The new project, co-sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, will use high-tech equipment borrowed from the exploration of space and the maintenance of nuclear power stations to penetrate the pit without contaminating it. ''This is the only place we have in Egypt that we know of that was deliberately sealed by the ancient Egyptians and perhaps has stayed sealed,'' said Dr. Omar el-Arini, an Egyptian scientist and adviser to the project who helped draft the original proposal for non-destructive exploration.<br><br>''It's a remote chance that the air is still that old,'' cautioned Elie Rogers, project coordinator for the National Geographic Society. ''Think of all the earthquakes, floods and the microfissures that may have occurred in the rock. But it's a chance that can't be passed up.''<br><br>For more than two years, the team has been assembling and developing techniques. They have drilled through limestone similar to the five-foot-thick slabs that cover the cavity. The site has been surveyed three times with ground penetrating radar to try to gauge the contours of the interior and choose the emptiest place to drill. The National Geographic Society even built a fake pharaonic tomb to test a remote-controlled camera.<br><br>The preparations have finally been completed. Later this week, the team is expected to start drilling a hole three and a half inches in diameter through one of the 40, 14-ton limestone blocks that cover the pit.<br><br>A special drill, similar to one used on Apollo missions to the moon, has been selected. It operates without any lubricant, to prevent the introduction of harmful moisture, and can work at a relatively slow speed to avoid causing tiny cracks in the surrounding stone, Arini said. To prevent any exchange of gases between the chamber and the outside atmosphere, a special air lock hasbeen designed by one of the team members, Robert Moore, an amateur Egyptologist and product development manager for the American power tool manufacturer, Black and Decker Inc.<br><br>Once the hole is made, air samples will be collected.<br><br>Then a tiny, remote-controlled camera on a pneumatic arm, like those used to look for cracks in nuclear power plants, will be lowered through the narrow opening to discover what, if anything, is inside.<br><br>Special sensors will also be inserted into the cavity to measure temperature, humidity and the concentration of various gases.<br><br>If the environment in the pit is found to be unsullied, Arini said, preservationists may gain a better understanding of how to protect artifacts unearthed after thousands of years from rapid decay.<br><br>''We hope we can simulate the same atmosphere in a museum environment for intensive care measures for something that is threatened, for example mummies,'' he said.<br><br>If a second pharaonic boat is found, curators might be able to preserve it better than the first boat, which was damaged during the decade it took to assemble it and was kept for years in conditions of excessive heat and humidity. Only five years ago was air conditioning installed in the glass- walled museum where the 140-foot- long boat, with its distinctive prow modeled after a bundle of papyrus reeds, now resides close to the place of its ancient burial. Beyond the secrets of preservation, scientists are interested in analyzing ancient air to learn more about present atmospheric conditions - in particular how mankind has polluted the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels and releasing ozone-destroying fluorocarbons.<br><br>Older air has been discovered in bubbles in ice caps, but not in sufficient quantity to conduct extensive tests, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<br><br>Team members include an ''air specialist,'' Dr. Pieter Tans of the University of Colorado, who does research for NOAA. Also associated with the project is Dr. Farouk el-Baz, an Egyptian-born scientist who worked on the Apollo missions for NASA and now directs the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University. Even if the air turns out to be disappointingly fresh and the pit otherwise empty, Egyptian officials say the project will have scientific merit. It will help refine the high-tech, non-destructive methods that have replaced the Raiders of the Lost Ark approach to archaeology."

    "title": "Godzilla Comes Home for Christmas",
    "text": "Godzilla has been awakened from a nine-year nap and, boy, is he grumpy. Salvaged from the ocean depths after poor box-office receipts forced him into retirement, Japan's rowdiest reptile is back in a tail-swishing new film that premiered Dec. 15.<br><br>This time, Godzilla is bigger and meaner than ever as he lurches through downtown Tokyo, noshing on nuclear reactors and doing to skyscrapers what macho men do to empty beer cans.<br><br>For Godzilla, this is the second character change since he first stomped across the silver screen in 1954. A villain back then, Godzilla got nicer in subsequent films until at last he was cast as a good monster, fighting alongside mankind for truth, justice and the Japanese way.<br><br>Alas, as Godzilla's demeanor improved, his box office appeal declined.<br><br>'The fans did not like Godzilla when he was good,' said Masaru Yabe, a spokesman for Godzilla's producers, Toho Productions. 'They wanted to see a bad Godzilla. They wanted to see him eat Tokyo again.'<br><br>And so in his new flick, entitled simply 'Godzilla,' it's no more Mr. Nice Lizard.<br><br>'In this film, we have returned to the original Godzilla. He is strong and powerful. He is a real monster,' said Koji Hashimoto, 'Godzilla's' director.<br><br>As the film opens, Godzilla has been awakened by a volcanic eruption. He's hungry after nine years -- and of course real monsters don't eat quiche.<br><br>Godzilla prefers plutonium, which he obtains by wading ashore and cracking open a nuclear reactor. So sated, he goes on to dispose of a Russian submarine, a squadron of U.S. jets, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and of course, central Tokyo. Along the way, he provokes a superpower confrontation and brings the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.<br><br>But wait. There is more to this monster than meets the eye. Behind all the smoke and fire, beneath the rubble of downtown Tokyo, there is a message. For Godzilla has been resurrected not merely to terrorize the world but to sermonize to it about the dangers of nuclear energy.<br><br>The United States and the Soviet Union want to nuke Godzilla, not realizing that this monster goes for MX missiles the way kids go for Hostess Twinkies. But the wise and moral Japanese prime minister refuses, arguing there must be a better way of solving the world's problems.<br><br>'In the first Godzilla movie in 1954, the monster was awakened by a nuclear explosion and the message was against nuclear testing,' said Hashimoto. 'This time the theme is broader -- the risk of nuclear energy in all its forms. This is the message I want to spread to the world through this film.'<br><br>The world, however, may not get to see the $6 million film unless someone is willing to pay the $5 million that Toho is asking for foreign distribution rights.<br><br>'We have had discussions with several companies including Paramount and Universal but they have not been successful. Their offers were too cheap,' said Kei Nakagawa, Toho's promotion director.<br><br>Nagagawa said the best offer so far has been $2 million, but that he believes someone will meet Toho's price once Godzilla proves his popularity in Japan again. 'We are sure the film will be a success. Then the foreign companies will change their minds,' he said. To ensure that it is a success, Toho has pumped $1.5 million into a massive promotional campaign that hasplastered Godzilla's monstrous face on everything from T-shirts to chewing gum labels. There are Godzilla dolls, Godzilla records and even a number fans can call to hear Godzilla screech over the phone. 'We have learned how to promote films by watching the way the Americans promote films like Ghostbusters,' said Nakagawa, who shows up for interviews wearing a varsity jacket with Godzilla's name emblazoned on the back.<br><br>And there's more. Spied on the wall of a Tokyo men's room recently was the legend:<br><br>'Godzilla lives.' "

    "title": "Palestinians declare independent state",
    "text": "ALGIERS, Algeria - To cheers and applause early this morning, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared independence for a Palestinian state and called on Palestinians around the world to make the state a reality.<br><br>Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), made the declaration at 1:40 a.m. (7:40 p.m. EST Monday) to climax a watershed meeting of the Palestinians' informal parliament. The meeting also approved a key United Nations Security Council resolution that recognizes Israel's right to exist. The declaration did not set out the new state's boundaries, which the Palestinians say should be determined in future negotiations. It had been expected that the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would be included in the homeland.<br><br>The news does not mean that the Palestinians automatically have a state.<br><br>Israel rejected results of the meeting in advance and does not intend to hand over the occupied territories simply because of a document.<br><br>In Washington on Monday, President Reagan said PLO recognition of Israel ''would be some progress,'' but added: ''There are other problems that remain to be solved.''<br><br>The declaration of independence came shortly after the Palestine National Council (PNC), a quasi-legislature of the PLO, voted overwhelmingly to accept U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, long the cornerstone of international efforts to secure peace in the Middle East. The resolution, formulated in 1967 after the Six-Day War, established the principle that all states in the region - including Israel - are entitled to live in peace ''within secure and recognized boundaries.'' It also calls for the convening of an international conference to negotiate a settlement of longstanding territorial disputes between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The vote in favor of the resolution, forced by PLO hard-liners who opposed its acceptance and led by Marxist guerrilla chiefs George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, was 253-46 with 10 abstentions. Arafat began his address to the conference in a subdued voice, reading a declaration that reviewed the long and tragic history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.<br><br>''Despite the historical injustice inflicted on the Palestinian-Arabic people,'' Arafat said the Palestinian parliament is now willing to base its declaration of independence on 41-year-old U.N. Resolution 181, which partitioned Palestine into two states - one Arab, one Jewish.<br><br>Arafat, wearing his customary combat fatigues, declared the independent state to the jubilant council members saying: ''In the name of God, in the name of the Palestinian people, and in the name of the Arab people, the Palestine National Council announces the existence of the Palestinian state. Palestine is for the Palestinians everywhere.''<br><br>Later he described the council's actions as proclaiming the establishment of ''a Palestinian state on Palestinian land with holy Jerusalem as its capital.''<br><br>The conference center on the outskirts of Algiers erupted in applause, and Arafat received a brief standing ovation. A few women ululated, the shrill cry emitted by Arab women in celebration and several balloons in the colors of the Palestinian flag - red, green, black and white - were tossed in the air. An Algerian band played the Palestinian national anthem, a Palestinian flag was raised, and Algeriaannounced its recognition of the new state.<br><br>Members of the audience interrupted Arafat's speech several times to chant slogans addressed to Israel. ''Listen, listen, Shamir, we want the right of self-determination,'' they yelled, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.<br><br>''Tell Shamir, tell Rabin that we will not give up until we have liberated our land,'' went another cry, referring to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin who has been in charge of suppressing the nearly 1-year-old uprising by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.<br><br>Nov. 15 had been declared in advance as Palestinian independence day, and the early morning statement was timed so Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories would wake up to the news.<br><br>But despite the cries and applause and chanting of slogans, the mood in the hall at the end of the three-day conference was relatively subdued.<br><br>PNC delegates said they realized they still have a long road ahead to achieve their goal of an independent homeland, but said they hoped the declaration would boost the morale of the Palestinians in the Israeli- occupied territories and around the world.<br><br>''The intifada (uprising) will have a new impetus,'' said Dr. Hanna Nasser, the president of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. ''Now the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories are in agreement on a well- defined aim.''<br><br>Nasser, who was deported by by Israel for his membership in the PLO a decade ago, added, ''I'm pleased we are in the process of getting our independent state. We declared it, we haven't gotten it yet, but at least it's a beginning.''<br><br>- Information from the Associated Press and the Washington Post was used in this report."

    "title": "Khadafy's Libya -- where Mao meets Daffy Duck",
    "text": "TRIPOLI, Libya - It was Saturday night at Sinbad's, Tripoli's premier state-owned restaurant, and the menu boasted a rare treat - meat.<br><br>At a corner table, a group of Soviets wearing dour expressions and imitation leather jackets were washing down the last of their meal with Jamahiriya Cola, the local version of Coke. Smiling down on them from the wall was a larger-than-life portrait of a man whose jowls were creased with sinuous lines that called to mind the dunes of the desert where he was born.<br><br>The smile, at once hard and serene, was lighted by a little green lamp that was intended to move in graceful circles around the portrait. Instead, it made palsied jerks, flickering across the face of Col. Moammar Khadafy, leader, teacher and self-proclaimed spiritual guide of Libya's so-called Green Revolution.<br><br>The smile is everywhere in Tripoli - in bakeries, where sweaty men in dirty aprons make bread while long queues of people wait outside; in the supermarkets, where there are long rows of empty shelves; at the city's few shabby movie houses.<br><br>At Sinbad's, a waiter serves the daily special - watery soup, cold French fries and thin strips of gray, overcooked beef - to a group of foreigners. He sees their looks of disappointment and says softly: \"Look, I know it's terrible, but you must understand the situation. It's all we've got. I'm sorry.\" Sixteen years after Khadafy overthrew King Idris, nine years after he undertook his Green Revolution and two years after the bottom began falling out of oil prices, Libya under the mercurial colonel has fallen on exceedingly hard times.<br><br>Essential commodities are nonexistent or at best scarce. Long lines form for everything from meat and bread to soap and diapers. Construction cranes stand idle against the stubby skyline; once signposts of progress, they serve as grave markers for dozens of construction projects that have been postponed or cancelled. Green Book<br><br>Although Libya is still better off than many of its neighbors - it is still the richest country in Africa - the sudden decline in the standard of living has fanned widespread discontent with Khadafy's regime, according to more than a score of diplomats, foreign businessmen and Libyans interviewed in Tripoli.<br><br>Western businessmen with access to high-level Libyan officials say these officials complain their efforts to cope with declining oil revenues have been hamstrung by Khadafy's determination to run Libya according to his eclectic Green Book philosophy, described by one observer as \"part Maoism, part Nasserism and part the world according to Daffy Duck.\"<br><br>One businessman who meets regularly with senior Libyan officials said, \"Everyone I talk to nowadays admits that the system doesn't work, and that they are fed up.\"<br><br>Diplomats say the unrest has become evident - in the streets, on university campuses and, more significant, in the ranks of the armed forces, 76,000 strong.<br><br>In the past six months there have been at least two food riots, several campus demonstrations and a reported coup attempt that ended in the death of Col. Hassan Ishkal, a Khadafy cousin. Some reports say Ishkal may have been shot by Khadafy himself. The drastic decline in oil earnings - to $11.2 billion last year and perhaps no more than $7 billion this year from $31 billion in 1980 - has forced the government to slash imports, suspend work on all but a few high- priority projects and delay payments to nervous Western and East Bloc creditors who collectively are owed an estimated $11.2 billion.But, so far, the economic crisis does not seem to have affected Khadafy's revolutionary ways. Military purchases from the East Bloc reportedly still run about $1.4 billion a year, and the colonel seems as determined as ever to spread his unique version of socialism beyond Libya's shores through what one diplomat calls his \"nuisance budget\" - the money he lavishes on revolutionary movements around the world.<br><br>Because of the secretive nature of such expenditures, and the fact that no budget has been announced for 1986, it is difficult to find out to what extent Khadafy's military adventures and his support for guerrilla organizations are sapping Libya's income.<br><br>But apart from the \"Great Man-Made River Project,\" an ambitious scheme to pump water from wells beneath the Sahara Desert to the faraway Libyan coast, it is clear that very little is being spent on anything else.<br><br>Imports were reduced last year to $2.5 billion from a budgeted $7 billion, and the level is believed to be even lower now. Until a hurried delivery of beef from Ireland a few weeks ago, meat had been unavailable for months. At the Jamahiriya supermarket, one of Tripoli's showcase stores, the cooler shelves are stocked with powdered milk, clarified butter, tomato paste, insecticide and tea - and nothing else.<br><br>So far, the government's response to economic problems has only seemed to aggravate them. Khadafy, for example, has sought to use the revenue crisis to further his ideas of revolutionary self-sufficiency. He has called on Libyans to stop relying on imports and to work harder in order to attain economic independence.<br><br>With only 3.5 million people, Libya is heavily dependent on foreign labor. Foreigners run most of the service industries, they work in the fields, and they are present in large numbers even in the armed forces, which rely heavily on pilots from Pakistan and technicians from other Arab and African countries, according to Western diplomats.<br><br>Tension in military<br><br>Although the food shortages and other economic hardships are the biggest source of discontent, other measures introduced or accelerated by Khadafy over the past year to further his Maoist experiment in social upheaval have also been unpopular, diplomats and other Tripoli residents say.<br><br>\"There were a lot of complaints last year when Khadafy decided that everybody up to the age of 55 or 60 had to serve one day per week and one month per year in the People's Army,\" a diplomat said, referring to the organization that according to Khadafy's Green Book will someday replace the standing army. Even though training \"seems to consist mostly of light exercises and a lot of shouting,\" most Libyans \"were shocked that they made aged people go to it,\" the diplomat said.<br><br>Most observers agree that if Khadafy faces any real threat it can only be from within the army, which is the only organized institution left in the country.<br><br>There is said to be tension among the military men. Diplomats say they are prohibited from having direct contact with the military, but rumors persist that some in the army are upset with the erosion of its prestige since Khadafy began setting up the rival People's Army two years ago.<br><br>Other diplomats say they doubt the army is capable of doing anything because Khadafy, who is aware of the unrest, has set up so many systems of control and surveillance that would-be plotters are discovered before they have a chance to act.<br><br>One point that virtually every diplomat, businessman and Libyan interviewed in Tripoli agrees on is that Khadafy's efforts to silence critics has had help from an unlikely quarter, the United States.<br><br>The U.S. attempt to force a confrontation with Khadafy in the Gulf of Sidra two weeks ago was evidently planned by the administration of President Ronald Reagan in the hope of stimulating dissatisfaction in the army and encouraging more coup attempts. But in the opinion of all the analysts interviewed here, the limited conflict that took place is likely to have the opposite effect\"This whole crisis has helped Khadafy immensely at a time when he really needed it,\" one diplomat said. \"Libyans may dislike Khadafy, but they are Arabs and they are very proud, and this was perceived as an attack not against Khadafy but against Libya, because Libyan territory was attacked and Libyan lives were lost.\" "

    "text": "WASHINGTON Legislation backed by the Bush administration as a master plan for America's future energy requirements effectively was killed Friday in the Senate when supporters failed to overcome a filibuster by lawmakers who oppose drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.<br><br>In an outcome that startled even the victors, supporters of the omnibus energy legislation fell 10 votes short of the 60 they needed to shut off the filibuster mounted by pro-environment senators.<br><br>\"This was a turning point for the Alaskan wilderness, for the environment and for energy policy in general,\" said Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.). \"We've drawn a line in the tundra. We've said to the big oil companies, we're not going to allow you to drill in the last great wildlife area in North America.\" President Bush was disdainful of the senators who forced the issue. \"They're worried about the caribou in Alaska when I'm worried about jobs for the American people,\" he said at a fund-raising dinner in Dallas. \"I'll go with the people. Let them go with the caribou.\"<br><br>The 50-44 vote, which both<br><br>sides had expected to be much closer, means that efforts to craft a comprehensive new national energy strategy are over for this year. Though opponents of the bill said they would begin drafting new energy legislation next week, Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), a supporter whose state would have received half the revenues generated by new oil drilling in the Arctic, ruled out a quick compromise.<br><br>\"We have killed in three days what it took over a year to develop,\" he said. \"Form a bill out of the ashes of this one? . . . Pick up the pieces and compromise? That's idiotic.\"<br><br>Acknowledging defeat, the bill's chief sponsor, Senate Energy Committee Chairman J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) said he would try to \"pull together a new bill.\" Whatever shape the new legislation takes next year, it will have to exclude the provision to open the 1.5- million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration, both sides agreed.

    "title": "EGYPTIANS REALLY LIVE FOR FEASTS THAT END FASTS OF RAMADAN",
    "text": "CAIRO, Egypt _ The ragged gray clouds swiftly scraping their way across the sky cast a shadow over the outdoor table where the men were seated, talking in low, almost hushed tones. There were 12 of them there, and there was something vaguely conspiratorial about their demeanor, about their quick, furtive glances, their obvious impatience<br><br>Every now and then they looked at their wristwatches, as if urging the hands forward to the appointed time. Then came the signal for which they had been waiting. For a moment they sat rigid and silent, listening to the cries from the mosques across the river Nile _ ``Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar (God is great).'' Then, rising abruptly, they turned and strode swiftly across the courtyard, toward a man in a white suit who waited for them at the far end. They carried knives, forks and spoons, and they looked hungry. The maitre d' handed them plates, and they quickly began heaping them with grilled lamb, chicken, stuffed grape leaves, salad and sweets from the long buffet table. Iftar, the nightly ``breakfast'' that follows a day of sunup-to-sundown fasting during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, had begun.<br><br>All across the Moslem world, from the jungles of Malaysia to the deserts of Saudi Arabia, similar scenes are being repeated nightly.<br><br>Ramadan, which began in Egypt April 29 this year, commemorates the time nearly 14 centuries ago when, according to Moslem belief, God revealed the first verses of the Koran to the Prophet Mohammed.<br><br>Reckoned by the lunar calendar, the month begins when the first sliver of the new moon appears, and it continues until the crescent reappears about 30 days later. During this period, Moslems are expected to abstain from food, drink, cigarettes and sex during daylight hours. Only sick people, pregnant women, travelers and soldiers at war are exempt from these restrictions.<br><br>In theory, Ramadan is a period of piety and praying, of sacrifice and charity toward the poor. In some countries, however, what is preached is not always what is strictly practiced.<br><br>In ultraconservative countries like Saudi Arabia, Koranic injunctions are followed to the letter _ at least in public. But in more open countries like Egypt, self-denial during the day is usually compensated for by overindulgence after dark. Indeed, Ramadan during the evening is a bit like Thanksgiving or Christmas in the West _ a time for feasting and family get-togethers.<br><br>Punctuality is not known to be an Egyptian trait, but the iftar feast beginning at sundown is one occasion when it is inexcusable to be late. In Cairo, a single volley from a cannon atop Saladin's ancient citadel signals the start of the feast and, as the word is spread from district to district via neighborhood mosques, 15 million Egyptians, utensils in hand, sit down to an evening meal that usually lasts for hours.<br><br>During Ramadan, virtually the entire country goes on an overnight shift. People leave work early, take long naps, get up for iftar and then stay awake until 3 or 4 in the morning, when they sit down to sohour, an early morning meal before sunrise. Then they nap for a few more hours before arriving at their offices bleary-eyed and late.<br><br>The strains of daytime fasting, of not eating, not drinking heavily sweetened tea and not smoking cigarettes _ pleasures elevated to the status of national pastimes in Egypt _ take their toll on the characteristic geniality of Egyptians. Although statistics are hard to come by, most Egyptians would readily agree that there are more quarrelsduring Ramadan, more fistfights and more traffic accidents than at other times of the year.<br><br>Indeed, a Cairo newspaper once complained that Ramadan had become ``synonymous with a short temper, apathy, insolence, day-long yawning, doing less work and, if possible, none.''<br><br>Despite the resurgence in recent years of Islamic fundamentalism, that state of affairs has not changed much.<br><br>The pious still preach against the commercialization of Ramadan, noting that the Prophet Mohammed broke his fast in the evenings with only dates and water. But the majority of Egyptians _ and this has always been their genius _ still find ways of softening their hardship with good humor, with an innate ability to enjoy themselves and a keen eye for any excuse to do it.<br><br>``Look, I am as religious as most men,'' said one of the diners plunging into his iftar feast at the outdoor restaurant on the Nile. ``But who says that if we have to suffer, we can't at least enjoy it?'

    "text": "Among Washington insiders, the acronym AIPAC has long aroused strong emotions ranging from fear and loathing to admiration and respect.<br><br>But these days, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee has lost some of its luster as it strives to adjust to new political realities in both Israel and the United States.<br><br>Known for its sophistication in pursuing its mandate to bolster U.S. support for Israel, the 38-year-old organization has bee publicly embarrassed twice in the past month.<br><br>First, its president, David Steiner, was tape-recorded boasting to a contributor that the organization had \"\"a dozen people'' in President-elect Bill Clinton's entourage and could influence the selection of the next secretary of state. Steiner also bragged that he had obtained \"\"almost a billion dollars in other goodies'' for Israel in secret talks with former Secretary of State James Baker.<br><br>After the tape was leaked to the Washington Times and published, Steiner recanted his remarks and resigned.<br><br>A week later, AIPAC was obliged to deny several published reports that some of its leaders had been lobbying against the appointment of Warren Christopher, director of the Clinton transition board, as secretary of state. Christopher served as deputy secretary in the Carter administration, which some Jewish groups think extracted excessive concessions from Israel to achieve a peace accord with Egypt.<br><br>The incidents were especially disconcerting to a group that had greeted the defeat of President Bush with evident relief.<br><br>The outgoing administration angered many Israel supporters by refusing to approve $10-billion in loan guarantees to resettle immigrants in Israel until the Jewish state agreed to stop building new settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The dispute was resolved only after the Labor Party defeated the Likud bloc in June elections and agreed to the administration's conditions.<br><br>AIPAC's potent reputation was forged in the early 1980s under the Reagan administration, which shared with Israel's Likud leadership a conservative worldview.<br><br>The lobby succeeded in defeating or heading off a number of arms sales to Arab states and claimed credit for the election defeats of such influential legislators as Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill., who was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and had voted for such sales.<br><br>But with the waning of the Cold War, Israel's strategic value as a buffer against Soviet expansionism diminished.<br><br>Critics, including many within the Jewish community, charged that AIPAC was slow to adjust. More seriously, the critics said, the lobby's leaders became too identified with the Likud government and came to regard opposition to Israeli policies as tantamount to anti-Semitism. Recent articles in the Village Voice quoted a former AIPAC employee as asserting that the lobby compiled an \"\"enemies list'' that included liberal Jews such as actor Richard Dreyfuss, a prominent supporter of the dovish group Peace Now.<br><br>AIPAC officials vehemently denied that they do more than maintain ordinary newspaper files about people who speak out on the Middle East.<br><br>\"\"The image of what we do is very different from the reality,'' said one veteran staffer.Michael Lerner, editor of the dovish U.S. publication Tikkun, disagreed.<br><br>He asserted that AIPAC officials had disparaged him to reporters in an effort to dissuade them from quoting him.<br><br>\"\"They hold a worldview that their perception of the needs of Israel justifies an immoral way of acting,'' he said. Such behavior, he added, actually hurts Jews and Israel because \"\"it plays to the worst anti-Semitic fantasies of what the Jewish people are.'' Visiting the United States in August, the new Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, also lambasted AIPAC tactics. \"\"You waged battles which were lost in advance and so you merely caused Israel damage by generating unnecessary antagonism,'' Rabin said, according to the Jerusalem Post. AIPAC officials assert that relations with the new Israeli government have been repaired and note that Rabin has agreed to come to the United States to address the lobby's annual policy conference.<br><br>Despite its recent travails, the organization retains many strengths. With a nationwide membership of 55,000 representing a cross section of American Jews, an annual budget of $15-million and a Washington staff of 140, it dwarfs other Jewish political groups and foreign policy organizations.<br><br>\"\"You have to admire AIPAC for its ability to hire the best people,'' said Gail Pressburg, co-director of the Washington office of Americans for Peace Now, a group with one-fifth AIPAC's membership. \"\"They have a very sophisticated lobbying operation and a strong grass-roots network.'' But congressional staffers and members of other liberal Jewish organizations said they think the recent incidents had caused significant damage.<br><br>\"\"The intimidation factor is definitely down on (Capitol) Hill, in the Jewish community and elsewhere,'' said a staffer at a rival Jewish group.<br><br>At a time when the nation is more focused on domestic affairs and when lobbies of all sorts are suspect, AIPAC may have its work cut out for itself simply to maintain the high level of U.S. support - more than $3- billion a year - Israel has received.<br><br>Although Clinton won nearly 80 percent of the Jewish vote, some of Israel's strongest supporters in Congress, such as Reps. Larry Smith, D-Fla., Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and Mel Levine, D-Calif., either did not run for re- election or lost on Nov. 3.<br><br>\"\"It's an absolutely fresh start and no one knows what to expect,'' said one senior Capitol Hill staffer."

Starting with this raw material, the Iraqis are trying to re-create the Babylonian landscape of Nebuchadnezzar's time when Babylon was the most magnificent city in the Near East.<br><br>The project began eight years ago but has recently picked up steam so that a half-dozen sites - a theater, several palaces, gates and temples - will be ready to receive thousands of visitors to an international cultural festival planned in September.<br><br>There has been some criticism of the swift restoration, which appears to consist chiefly of laying fireproof bricks on top of the ancient foundations. Better, some restorers think, to have left the uneven old walls, some with the heads of dragons, the bodies of fish, the tails of snakes and the legs of lions and eagles.<br><br>The new brickwork clashes with the old, like a modern extension on a Victorian town house. At the entrance to the city, next to the required picture of President Hussein, the Iraqis have erected a half-sized model of the Ishtar Gate, which gives the site a Walt Disney flavor. (The beautifully glazed tiles of the original now reside in a museum in East Berlin.)<br><br>The additions don't seem to have bothered Iraqi tourists, who come to enjoy the pure air and tranquil atmosphere and have littered the grounds with sardine and soda cans for future archaeologists to uncover. They also have left writing on the walls, though not quite on the order of the injunction to the Biblical King Belshazzar that he had been ''weighed in the balance and found wanting,'' and that his kingdom's days were numbered. The new inscriptions, which cover the walls of the restored temple to the Goddess Emach, say ''Felix was here'' and Pedro and Ahmed and Aladdin.<br><br>For the Hussein government, Babylon is a canvas on which to inscribe a more political statement. Bogged down in a seemingly endless war with Iran, the Iraqis are treating the city as a symbol of their superiority over the Persians who conquered Babylon in 539 B.C. and whose descendants have been fighting Iraq for nearly 6 1/2 years.<br><br>Official guides at the site, 50 miles south of Baghdad, point out the lion of Babylon, the stone figure of the animal pinning the prone body of a man, as signifying that ''no enemy can enter the city of Babylon.''<br><br>The city's ancient defeat is blamed on the Jews, who were brought to Babylon as slaves after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem in 586 B.C., and then helped the Persians to gain liberation. The implication is that Israel, which has been selling arms to Iran, is trying to make history repeat itself, but this time it will fail.Iraqi officials also fault ancient Jewish prudery for inspiring New Testament writers to give Babylon its biblical reputation as ''the mother of harlots and of Earth's abominations'' that, according to the book of Revelation, will be destroyed in one hour on Judgment Day.<br><br>Munir Bashir, a master of the ud, or Arabic lute, who is organizing the September cultural festival, said he would rather focus on Babylon's more uplifting side.<br><br>''Of course, in every time, there is corruption. There is good and bad,'' Bashir said in an interview. ''We will show the people the good things of the period when Babylon was the capital of world civilization and a giver of law and language and science and music and poetry.'' Bashir would like the festival to reflect that past glory. He has asked nations around the world to send their best performers - the Opera Ballet from France, the Kirov Ballet from the Soviet Union and La Scala from Italy, but is awaiting their response.<br><br>From the United States, Bashir has requested another kind of culture - the pop star Madonna. This is a concession to his 17-year-old son who, Bashir explains, ''likes Madonna too much.''<br><br>Bashir has also invited international film stars, whom he will ask to recite translations of the code of Hammurabi, the great king who lived nearly 4,000 years ago and gave the world its first complete, if harsh, legal code. On a lighter note, Bashir said the festival would feature modern conceptions of Babylonian music, costumes, food and even money. The musician-impresario scoffed at suggestions that foreign performers and tourists might be leery of coming to a country in wartime. Babylon has never been hit by an Iranian missile, he said, and even Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini would not stoop that low.<br><br>''If Khomeini tried to bomb Babylon that means he becomes the lowest bit of dirt because he wants to destroy culture,'' Bashir said."

    "title": "Peres, Egypt agree to work toward peace conference",
    "text": "CAIRO - Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres agreed with Egypt Friday to work toward an international peace conference in 1987 as the prelude for direct talks between Israel and its Arab adversaries.<br><br>A joint communique read at the end of Peres' three-day visit by his Egyptian counterpart, Esmat Abdel Meguid, said the two delegations were ''convinced there is a need to take necessary measures to expedite the peace process and produce agreement through the convening in 1987 of an international conference leading to direct negotiations between all the parties concerned.''<br><br>By explicitly calling for a conference this year, the statement went a little further than the communique ending Peres' last visit to Egypt six months ago. Then he and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak pledged to make 1987 a ''year of negotiations for peace.''<br><br>However, the new statement was no clearer than the last about how to bring about a peace conference. It made no reference to the ''new ideas'' that Peres said Thursday had been raised that day in a two-hour meeting with Mubarak.<br><br>The Israeli foreign minister held an unscheduled second meeting with Mubarak Friday, joining him for breakfast before flying back to Tel Aviv.<br><br>Egypt is eager to end its isolation as the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel. It has endorsed Jordan's call for an international conference as a framework for new negotiations. But formidable obstacles to such a conference remain. Beyond the touchy questions of Arab and Soviet participation, a major hurdle exists in Israel itself. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the right-wing Likud Bloc leader who traded jobs with Peres in October, adamantly opposes an international conference, asserting that the Soviet Union and radical Arabs would use it to demand extreme territorial concessions from Israel. Peres and the Reagan administration, however, have a different concept, viewing an international conference merely as a way to facilitate direct talks involving Israel, Jordan and selected Palestinians. Egypt seemed to endorse this interpretation in Friday's communique, and Meguid repeated later that the talks with Peres had ''put in a very clear perspective the ultimate aim of an international conference (is) to have direct negotiations between the parties concerned.''<br><br>An equally thorny question involves representation for the Palestinians of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Peres hinted at progress over this issue earlier this week, but differed gently with Meguid in their remarks following the reading of the communique.<br><br>Asked whether the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) could participate, Peres said it ''has excluded itself'' from a seat at a peace conference because of its refusal to recognize Israel and renounce terrorism. He noted that Jordan, the Israeli neighbor that has shown the greatest willingness to follow Egypt and negotiate peace with Israel - provided that it has the cover of an international conference - had ''tried to reach an agreement with the the PLO and failed.'' But Meguid said ''we cannot start excluding or separating the parties.'' He said the question of who should represent the Palestinians was ''first and foremost the concern of the Palestinians themselves, and then the other parties have to agree about that.''<br><br>Peres, in a briefing to reporters Thursday, hinted that prominent non-PLO Palestinians would be acceptable to Egypt as well as to Israel.<br><br>While declining public comment on Israeli internal politics, Egyptian officials would clearly like to help Peres become prime minister again. By coming to Egypt and reaffirming support for an international peaceconference, Peres seemed to be laying the groundwork for a future Israeli Cabinet crisis. Shamir, in the United States earlier this week, said Peres had ''no mandate'' to expand the peace process.<br><br>''The significance of the Peres visit is that both he and Egypt want to keep the peace process moving and moving faster,'' said a Western diplomat in Cairo. ''Ultimately, if there is progress, it could lead to a bust-up in the Israeli coalition, but while it's always possible for people there to lose their cool, I don't think it's going to happen in the next few weeks.''<br><br>The diplomat added that he expected the Reagan administration to become ''reinvolved'' in the peace process and predicted that Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy would return to the Middle East toward the end of next month."

    "text": "China said Thursday workers in a radio factory have discovered how to age wine in minutes instead of years in a process that could revolutionize the vintner's art.<br><br>If perfected, the process could be an answer for connoisseurs too impatient to lay down their bottles of wine for the 10 or more years it often takes for wines to mature.<br><br>The technique, developed at a radio factory in a remote northern province bordering the Soviet Union, reportedly achieves in 12 minutes what it normally takes eight years of bottle aging to accomplish. The China Daily, Peking's English-language newspaper, said Thursday the process has been tested at two dozen wineries across China with 'good results.'<br><br>Although the results varied, the newspaper said it was nevertheless a breakthrough in the age-old vintner's art.<br><br>In Jilin province, just south of Heilongjiang province radio factory where the process was invested, the Baicheng Winery said it used the device to achieve in 10 minutes the aging affects of a year in storage, the report said. 'Newly made wines are harsh and astringent to the taste,' the China Daily noted, because of the presence of substances called tannins.<br><br>In traditional wine making, it takes years for tannins break down and interact with acids, fruits and other components, producing a more mellow and complex flavor of a mature wine.<br><br>Until now, it was thought the only way to get a quality, mature wine was to wait.<br><br>'But wine storage creates problems,' the Peking newspaper observed. 'First, there is a delay in marketing and thus in capital turnover. Second, there is the necessity for large warehouses and airtight containers.'<br><br>The process was developed at the Qiqihair Fifth Radio Factory utilizing radio, sound and light waves to speed the aging process, the report said.<br><br>The China Daily said one of the sound and light devices costs between $10,000 and $15,000 and is suitable for a medium-size winery.<br><br>The newspaper did not say what kind of wine was prematurely aged with the device, but China's grape wine is mostly heavy and sweet. The quality of its dry wines, compared to a French bordeaux or a California cabernet sauvignon, is poor. "

    "text": "President Chun Doo Hwan's historic visit to Japan, the first by a South Korean leader, may remove some of the antagonism and resentment that have long stained Japanese-Korean relations.<br><br>But it is not expected to do much for Japan's disadvantaged Korean minority, whose predicament is a legacy of the two countries' bitter past.<br><br>Descendents of forced laborers brought over before and during World War II, the 675,000 Koreans in Japan account for more than 80 percent of the resident alien population. Although most were born here and speak Japanese fluently, they are burdened by negative stereotypes and victimized by what they regard as endemic Japanese racism.<br><br>'Japanese believe that Koreans are violent, poor and dirty,' said Bae Jung Do, a Korean who heads the church- affiliated Research Action Institute for Koreans in Japan.<br><br>South Korea has served notice that Chun will raise the issue of better treatment for Japanese-Koreans in his talks with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone Sept. 6-8.<br><br>Koreans have made economic and social strides in recent years, but they still find many doors closed to them. They enjoy the same rights as Japanese to free education, but even those with prestigious university degrees find that the ladder of success leads nowhere. 'For Koreans, it stops half way up,' said a Western diplomat.<br><br>'Koreans run the businesses that Japanese despise,' adds Akiko Yamaguchi Lee, a Japanese married to a Korean. 'Even our university graduates have to work in bars or as manual laborers because the big Japanese companies won't hire them.' The Korean Residents' Union estimates that Korean men earn on average $425 per month less than their Japanese counterparts.<br><br>'They have prospered in recent years like everyone else, but Koreans are still on the bottom of the social scale,' said a Western diplomat.<br><br>Prejudice stems from the racial and ethnic homogeneity of the Japanese that, as a l984 U.S. State Department report on human rights notes, 'makes them less willing or able to integrate alien residents into their society.'<br><br>The closed nature of Japanese society is something foreign residents frequently complain about. With the Koreans, the problem also has historical roots that have created an enmity often compared to that between the English and the Irish. This enmity traces back to the first Japanese invasions of Korea in the 16th century, although the bitterest memories date from Japan's colonial rule between 1904 and the end of World War II.<br><br>So bitter are those memories that no South Korean leader has been able to bring himself to visit Japan until now. And even now, the visit, which both governments see as an historic turning point in relations, has touched off protests in South Korea by those who still cannot forgive or forget.<br><br>After the war, most of the 2.4 million Koreans in Japan were repatriated. Those who remained, preferring Japanese democracy even with its prejudice to the political turmoil in their newly divided homeland, lost their Japanese citizenship in 1952 when the San Francisco Peace Treaty formally stripped Japan of its colonies.<br><br>They are now free to apply for new citizenship, but only about 100,000 -- less than one-sixth -- have done so because of what Bae and others charge is the restrictive nature of Japanese naturalization laws.<br><br>The laws require foreigners applying for Japanese citizenship to furnish proof of their 'assimilation into Japanese society' -- a nebulous demand that means 'we have to take Japanese names and renounce our Korean identities,' said Lee.Although the name change is not a legal requirement, Bae said many Koreans have been denied citizenship because their refusal to assume Japanese names was taken as evidence of their 'failure to assimilate.'<br><br>The State Department human rights report concurs, noting that 'only a few' Korean residents have become citizens under their own names.<br><br>'Our roots are here and we want to remain. But we are also proud of our heritage as Koreans. We don't want to lose that,' said Bae. ---<br><br>South Korea in recent years has lent vocal support to the Korean community's demands for equal rights, and especially for the abolition of a law requiring resident aliens to submit to periodic fingerprinting.<br><br>Fingerprinting is required of all foreign residents, but Koreans argue that their permanent place in Japanese society should exempt them. Korean community leaders doubt Chun will press the issue when other matters of more concern to South Korea -- technology transfer, trade and tensions with North Korea -- are also on the agenda.<br><br>Still others feel that Japanese prejudice against them is too deeply ingrained to be moved by soft, diplomatic words.<br><br>'The two governments will be concerned only about their own profit,' said Bae. 'For us, not much will change.' "

    "title": "Tunisia: A nation caught in the middle",
    "text": "TUNIS, Tunisia - The well-behaved little country of Tunisia lives in a rough neighborhood. Strategically situated in northernmost North Africa only 90 miles from Europe, it is a Florida-sized squiggle of land wedged between Algeria and Libya, two big countries with correspondingly large aspirations for regional leadership and with close ties to the Soviet bloc.<br><br>Under the 32-year reign of President Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia managed to keep both neighbors at bay and maintain a staunchly pro-Western foreign policy.<br><br>Since Bourguiba was ousted by his former interior minister, Zine Abidine Ben Ali last Nov. 7, however, the juggling act has become a little more difficult.<br><br>Tunisia has come under increasing pressure from Algeria to allow Libya to join a treaty of ''fraternity and concord'' that was signed in 1983 by Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania, Algeria's neighbor to the southwest. On the face of it, the treaty contains nothing objectionable. On the contrary, it would oblige Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi, in theory, to respect Tunisia's sovereignty and borders.<br><br>But admitting Libya to the treaty would make Morocco, the other pro-Western government of the Maghreb, as North Africa is known, feel isolated.<br><br>It would also upset the Reagan administration, which having failed to kill Gadhafi in the 1986 bombing of his barracks in Tripoli, has since tried to isolate him and objects to the treaty as a crack in his diplomatic quarantine.<br><br>''Sure the United States is putting pressure on us,'' Tunisian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Mestiri said in a recent interview. ''But we cannot say Gadhafi should not sign the treaty. The Algerians are saying we have to do something with Gadhafi, either unity or separation. This treaty would be separation.''<br><br>The urbane Tunisians would prefer to have nothing to do with their uncouth neighbor, who is forever proposing ''unity'' with other Arab governments - and lashing out at them when he is rebuffed.<br><br>Gadhafi long held a grudge against Bourguiba, who agreed to a merger with Libya in 1974 but changed his mind 24 hours later. Libyan agents were suspected of having a hand in riots in Tunis in 1978. Two years later, Libyan-trained commandos tried to foment an uprising in the remote central Tunisian city of Gafsa. But accidents of geography and demography have created mutual needs.<br><br>Libya, 10 times the size of Tunisia, has only half as many people. Blessed with greater oil riches, Libya has traditionally absorbed thousands of Tunisian workers, who would otherwise have swelled the already large ranks of the unemployed.<br><br>''We do need Libya and that is the problem,'' a senior Tunisian official said. In 1985, Gadhafi, facing an economic squeeze of his own because of falling oil revenues, wreaked havoc with his neighbor's economy by expelling more than 30,000 Tunisian workers over three months. Tunisia responded by breaking diplomatic relations. They were restored in December after Libya paid $10-million to a fund to reimburse workers with broken contracts and unfroze the assets of Tunisian businessmen. A visit to Tunisia by Gadhafi was expected soon after. But the Libyan leader abruptly canceled a trip scheduled for Jan. 16 when he discovered that the commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet was due in Tunis at the same time. He finally visited Tunisia this month.''We have no complexes in this country about our friendship with the United States,'' said Foreign Minister Mestiri, explaining why the visit of the American commander was not postponed to accommodate Gadhafi.<br><br>At the same time, the veteran diplomat acknowledged that relations with the United States have not been the same since President Reagan defended the October 1985 Israeli bombing of a Palestine Liberation Organization enclave outside Tunis in which a dozen Tunisians were killed.<br><br>''We do not want the damage to be permanent, provided the Americans help us, which is not the case,'' Mestiri continued. He complained that American aid to Tunisia had dropped so much in recent years that Tunisia would this year be paying more in debt service on past American loans than it would be receiving in new assistance. He called for forgiveness of military debts incurred in the late 1970s and 1980s, when Tunisia bought heavily from the United States to build up its small army against the Libyans.<br><br>''This is a catastrophe for us and for relations with the United States,'' the foreign minister said of the debt issue.<br><br>Mestiri's tough comments were in keeping with the new Tunisian emphasis on the country's ''Arab-Islamic character.''<br><br>Under Bourguiba, Tunisia's Western orientation was so strong that even an American diplomat in Tunis once described it as ''unnatural'' for a country of Tunisia's size, location and heritage.<br><br>In 1965, for example, Bourguiba, who had never appreciated the pan-Arabist views of then-Egyptian leader Gamel Abdel Nasser, shocked fellow Arabs by becoming the first regional leader to advocate a peaceful settlement with the Arabs' arch-enemy, Israel. In 1982, he allowed the PLO to move its political headquarters to Tunis after the organization was pushed out of Lebanon, but only did so under pressure from the United States.<br><br>''Under Bourguiba, people were under the impression that Tunisia was almost anti-Arab,'' Mestiri said. ''But now this is finished. . . . As a small country, we feel we can have good relations with everybody and play a positive role in our region and in the Middle East as a whole.''"

Forbes caused more trouble in 2 weeks in China than any other distinguished American visitor since the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations. He flew a hot air balloon on a forbidden flight over Peking, accidentally penetrated a high-security military base, crashed into a brick wall and kept a company of officials racing around China after him, chiefly to shout, 'No, Mr. Forbes, you can't do that.'<br><br>He reacted to the word 'no' like a bull charging a red cape. But a sense of humor and a little help from friends always seemed to smooth things out.<br><br>For Forbes also had what the Chinese call 'guanxi' -- connections.<br><br>His visit was arranged by industrialist Armand Hammer, who got Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's personal approval for the the Malcolm Forbes motorcycle and balloon U.S.-China amity tour.<br><br>Though there is some question whether he contributed to U.S.-China amity or took advantage of it, Forbes said he and the five Americans with him 'had a ball.' The Chinese were forgiving enough to invite him back again -- though they did not suggest a date.<br><br>Forbes arrived in China Oct. 5 and headed for Xian in the center of the country, his launching pad for a 1,500- mile, 12-day journey to Peking with five matching motorcycles and the 74-foot-tall multi-colored Forbes friendship balloon.<br><br>He arranged a ballooning demonstration at the Xian sports stadium to delight his Chinese hosts. But delight turned to something close to horror when they saw Forbes and several assistants ascend up and over the stadium wall.<br><br>'We got all these frantic calls over the walkie-talkie saying 'would we please come down at once,'' Forbes said. 'I tried to explain to them that landing a balloon is not as easy as taking off in one.'<br><br>Forbes proved that several minutes later when he crashed into the top of an unmortared brick wall -- doing more damage to the wall than the gondola -- as he thudded to a landing in a nearby field.<br><br>Dressed in black motorcycle leathers and matching red vests, the Forbes team set out from Xian Oct. 8 with the balloon in two for a zig-zagging journey across central China.<br><br>They covered country seldom seen by tourists, but any notion they were seeing the 'real' China was quickly dispelled by the shrieking sirens of the police cars that preceded them all the way.<br><br>They slept in hotels where they could and tents where they couldn't and passed through towns where people thought 'the balloon was a satellite and the Harley Davidsons some sort of atomic weapons,' Forbes said. They arrived in Peking Oct. 19.<br><br>After the requisite banquets, a news conference and an impulsive midnight meeting with visiting Pakistani President Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq, Forbes got up early on the morning of the 20th and roared out to theGreat Wall to again float his balloon.<br><br>But mindful of what had happened in Xian, the Chinese refused to allow him to untie the tether this time.<br><br>'Maybe tomorrow,' Forbes told a reporter trying to overcome his terror long enough to interview him from the back of his motorcycle as they roared down a mountain road to Peking.<br><br>The next day, Forbes inflated his balloon once more for a group of athletes at a stadium outside Peking, giving them rides up to the length of the tether and down again.<br><br>When China's champion javelin thrower climbed into the gondola, Forbes glanced down at the ring of suspicious security men and untied the tether.<br><br>'No free flight, no free flight,' they shouted as Forbes and his startled guest drifted up and over the city.<br><br>About 15 minutes later, Forbes' voice crackled over the walkie-talkie. 'I dont know where we landed, but there are cannons pointed at us.'<br><br>Forbes had put down in the middle of a restricted army base. Within seconds he was surrounded by delighted soldiers and a worried commander who kept gesturing for him to take off again. Forbes presented him with a balloon-shaped commemorative pin and took his picture.<br><br>'It wasn't to be naughty and it wasn't to be unfriendly,' he told his hosts later that night at a farewell banquet. 'It was just to demonstrate that ballooning is a wonderful sport.'<br><br>Forbes admitted he liked all the publicity, but insisted the reason he did all he did was his love of motorcycling and ballooning and his desire to be the first to do both in China.<br><br>'Also I had a ball.'<br><br>Judging from the laughter around the banquet tables on his last night in Peking, his Chinese hosts did too.

The offensive came less than 24 hours after the Arab League reported a new peace agreement.<br><br>The new Syrian advance came 30 miles south of Beirut against Palestinian positions some 12 miles east of Moslem-held Sidon, the 5.000-year-old one time chief city of Phoenicia which was sacked by the Philistines and visited by Jesus. Their objectives appeared to be encirclement of the port which would not only isolate the Palestinians' major stronghold in the south but cut their main supply route to Beirut, 30 miles to the north.<br><br>Although the attack followed by hours an announced peace accord, an Arab League spokesman indicated it did not come as a surprise and said \"our agreement still stands.\"<br>Christians disagreed saying the new cease-fire agreement was \"never meant to succeed\" and calling the new Syrian offensive \"only the start...of the final battle\" in Lebanon's 18-month-old civil war.<br><br>A Palestinian military communique said the attack was launched at the \"Roum-Azour Homsieh Axis from Jezzine,\" where Syria had amassed troops following their thrust early this month that ousted the Palestinians and leftists from strategic mountain positions east of Beirut.<br>\"At 11:55 a.m. 5:55 a.m. EDT this morning an estimated two battalions of Syrain armor and infantry launched a full-scale heavy attack against our positions,\" a Palestinian military communique said.<br><br>\"As with their earlier assaults, artillery bombardment was fierce and our fighters reported that hundreds of shells were falling on their positions which, however, are still standing fast in the face of the Syrian advance,\" the communique said.<br><br>\"The fact that this attack comes but hours after agreement was reached at Chtaura to end hostilities proves our suspicions that for the Syrians, the Chtaura talks were only a charade,\" a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO said.<br>Correspondents touring the Roum area and quoted Palestinian commanders as saying about 1,500 Syrian'troops backed by tanks and mine sweepers took part in the attack.<br><br>The reporters were not allowed close enough to the fronts to determine how far the Syrians had advanced. But they said the Palestinians told them the attack from Jezzine was along two fronts, one west toward Sidon and the other south toward Maghgara.<br><br>The Arab League envoy who mediated and announced Monday night's draft peace agreement between Syria, Lebanon, and the PLO said he had \"been informed of the new developments."
