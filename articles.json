    "title": "Attack on politburo sparked Yemeni civil war",
    "text": "ADEN - A bid by former president Ali Nasser Mohammed to massacre his rivals in the politburo of the ruling Yemeni Socialist party, sparked a civil war that left up to 12,000 dead last month, South Yemeni officials say.<br><br>Survivors of the massacre said that Mohammed called the politburo together at 10 a.m. on Jan. 13 but did not attend himself. Instead, he sent his bodyguards, who went through the motions of preparing the president's papers and serving tea to the others. Opened fire<br><br>These courtesies dispensed with, the bodyguards produced machine pistols and opened fire on the men in the room, killing several of the president's opponents, including Vice-president Ali Ahmed Antar and Defence Minister Salih Muslih Qasim.<br><br>The shooting summoned the victims' bodyguards and a wild gunfight erupted. Salim and two other politburo members escaped.<br><br>The fighting escalated quickly after that, and by the next day fierce rocket and tank battles were raging in several parts of the city between opposing units of the armed forces and the tribal militias summoned down from the surrounding hills. The evacuation of foreigners began on Friday, Jan. 17, on the fifth day of the fighting that was to last for another week. After several failed attempts, the Soviets arranged a limited truce on a beachfront near their battered embassy in Khormaksar, one of two districts in the city where the heaviest fighting took place. The first to leave, aboard a Soviet freighter, were women and children.<br><br>The next day, about 800 people, among them most of the diplomatic community, gathered on the beach at daybreak to await evacuation by the British royal yacht Britannia, which was in the area en route to New Zealand when the fighting broke out.<br><br>As Bryan Wannop, the resident representative of the United Nations Development Program, said later, the evacuation was proceeding as planned when, in mid-morning, with half the evacuees still waiting on the beach, the Britannia suddenly turned and steamed away.<br><br>\"We were flabbergasted,\" recalled Wannop, a Canadian. \"At first we couldn't believe it. Without warning, they set sail and left us.\" The commander of the Britannia, Admiral John Garnier, later told reporters the ceasefire was collapsing and that shelling was advancing toward the beach, forcing a suspension of the evacuation. But Wannop said the area around the beachfront was calm for another 20 hours.<br><br>The evacuees spent the next several days huddled in basements and moving from building to building in search of food and water, both of which were running low. Some put sugar in seawater to make it potable. At the British embassy, they drank and bathed in champagne. During this time, while the Soviets and the British continued to try to negotiate a truce and select an alternate evacuation site, two heroes emerged - Wannop and Abbas Zaki, senior representative in Aden of the Palestine Liberation Organization.<br><br>Zaki was several hundred kilometres from Aden, in a remote part of the country, when the fighting broke out. Upon hearing the news, he drove to the capital, arriving on the fourth day. Under his direction, the PLO ran supply convoys for the foreigners, crossing the lines to bring back food and bottled water scavanged from abandoned apartment buildings.\"The PLO played a very responsible role; they helped the rest of us immensely,\" said Wannop, who himself led convoys around the city, a white flag flying from his car, to help gather together foreigners stranded in different areas.<br><br>After the first week, the fighting began to taper off as Mohammed's resistance crumbled. Scattered shooting continued, but by the 10th day an evacuation route had been secured through rebel territory from Khormaksar to Little Aden, site of a sprawling oil refinery west of the capital.<br><br>By Thursday morning, Jan. 23, the rescue operation had been completed as the last of nearly 7,000 foreigners - 5,000 Soviet nationals and 2,000 people of other nationalities - set out for the Red Sea port of Djibouti in Soviet, French and British ships.<br><br>Aden is quiet now, and much of the war damage has been cleared away. Members of the new \"collective leadership,\" in their first interviews with Western reporters, said they want the foreigners to return as soon as possible to finish work on the various projects abandoned in the fighting.<br><br>The new leaders are also mounting a propaganda campaign to expose what they assert were the myriad crimes of \"Ali Nasser and his conspiratorial clique.\" They complain about descriptions of themselves in the Western press as Marxist hardliners and seem eager to portray their differences with Mohammed as personal rather than ideological.<br><br>It seems unlikely that Mohammed can make a military comeback, but with outside support he could be a threat and a source of instability for his successors.<br><br>Aware of this, the new leaders have taken pains to assure people in the other Yemen and in the surrounding Persian Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait that they will continue to pursue Mohammed's conciliatory foreign policies and keep the door open to Western investment.<br><br>But for the time being at least most of the gulf countries seem to be unconvinced. Many seem to be waiting for the outcome of what they are certain will be another power struggle between the survivors before recognizing the new government.<br><br>At the moment, the government is headed, nominally, by Mohammed's prime minister, Haider abu Bakr Attas, who was visiting India when the fighting broke out. Authoritative sources point out that Attas has no independent tribal power base and they believe that he will be in office only so long as the jittery gulf states need assurances that the old regime's moderate foreign policies will continue.<br><br>Emerging strongman<br><br>In the meantime, the emerging strongman, according to these sources, seems to be Salim Saleh Mohammed, secretary of the central committee of the Yemeni Socialist party and a survivor of the Jan. 13 ambush.<br><br>Mohammed, 39, fought the British as a teenager. He has held a series of senior party posts and served as foreign minister under Ali Nasser Mohammed from 1980 to 1983.<br><br>Bidh, the local government minister, is a possible rival. The Soviet news agency Tass reported several days ago that he had been chosen to succeed Salim Saleh Mohammed as party secretary. But western diplomats see this as a sign that Mohammed will succeed Attas as president. Questions remain concerning the Soviet Union's murky role in the coup. Some Western diplomats monitoring events from afar say it is inconceivable to them that the Soviet Union did not know that a move to oust Ali Nasser Mohammed was afoot.<br><br>"

    "title": "TV addiction grows in China",
    "text": "The Chinese may not know who shot J.R. yet, but more and more of them are becoming addicted to television -- a development that offers both promise and problems for China's leadership.<br><br>Armed with marching orders to go forth and 'enrich the cultural life of the masses,' the television industry has been at the forefront of China's effort to shrug off the legacy of the chaotic Cultural Revolution and merge into the modern world. There are now an estimated 16 million TV sets in China reaching 400 million people -- 40 percent of China's population and nearly twice the population of the United States. Production of TV sets -- still mostly small black-and-white models - increased from 3,000 sets in 1968 to 4.8 million in 1981.<br><br>A 12-inch black-and-white set, at $210, is fast becoming standard equipment in urban households. A top-of- the-line, 20-inch color TV is a status symbol whose $1,100 price tag, equal to three years salary for the average worker, apparently is no deterrent to the new Chinese consumer.<br><br>China's one national channel and its 29 regional stations each broadcast about 30 hours per week.<br><br>'Television is coming along very, very rapidly here,' a Western diplomat said. 'It's now about where it was in the 1950s in the United States.'<br><br>The major limitation now is programming which, for technological and ideological reasons, still lags far behind the demand it has created.<br><br>General programming in the evenings and on Sundays is still dominated by a handful of 'proletarian' dramas whose predictable plots have been run and rerun ad nauseam. 'They show the same shows over and over and I already know what's going to happen,' confided one Chinese viewer, who requested anonymity because revolutionary inspiration in China is not supposed to be boring. Maybe because of this, the most popular program in China is the nightly news, 30 minutes of local, national and international reportage.<br><br>On the news the other night, a young woman with a Western hairdo and a smart white dress provided the narration as the screen behind her dissolved from the determined face of a Chinese soccer player kicking home a goal to an image of Beirut burning under the thunder of Israeli guns.<br><br>The news in China is one of the few programs that's always changing, which helps account for its appeal.<br><br>Faced with increasing demand, officials are expanding production of made-for-TV dramas and looking abroad for foreign fare.<br><br>The 'Man from Atlantis' was shown two years ago and a regional station is negotiating for the old 'Rifleman' series.<br><br>The Chinese recently concluded an agreement for 24 National Geographic specials and a delegation is going to the United States this October to talk to serial distributors. 'The problem,' one Western diplomat said, 'is that up to now the Chinese have been unwilling to pay the going rate.' They are only just coming to accept that they must part with some of their foreign exchange for the likes of'Kramer Vs. Kramer,' a film they have expressed an interest in.<br><br>'They can buy an awful lot of 'Leave it to Beaver' if they want to,' the diplomat said. 'But they realize their viewers want something more than that.' "

But, although Hu said improving the lot of the peasants and generally raising living standards was the country's first economic goal, he warned it would probably take another decade for the full benefits of the ambitious economic drive to trickle down to the masses.<br><br>Hu also called for an increase in Chinese exports and reiterated Deng's pledge to keep the economic door open to the West.<br><br>On Wednesday, Deng declared that China will 'unswervingly follow the policy of opening to the outside world,' but the 78-year-old leader also made an apparent concession to those concerned with side effects of foreign contact.<br><br>'At the same time,' he said, 'we will keep a clear head, firmly resist corosion by decadent ideas from abroad and never permit the bourgeois way of life in our country.'<br><br>Reunifcation with Taiwan, modernization with Western help and fighting hegemony -- China's code word for Soviet expansion -- are the goals for this decade, Deng said.

    "title": "IN CAIRO, IT'S RAINING CATS AND MORE CATS",
    "text": "HASSAN Hafez, a senior member of Egypt's Parliament, was sitting at his desk, discoursing on the merits of using waste water for land reclamation, when his exposition was interrupted by a commotion in the hall.<br><br>Moments later, a round, furry projectile, slightly larger than a football, flew through the air and landed on Hafez's desk. Then, scattering papers and pens to the floor, it bounded off and disappeared around a corner, with a broom-wielding janitor in hot pursuit. Hafez barely had time to recover his papers, if not his composure, when the scene was repeated. The furry football bounded once more across the desk and flew out the door, followed by the red-faced janitor. There was a moment of embarrassed silence.<br><br>\"I am very truly sorry,\" Hafez said, bending over to pick up his papers again. \"But we just can't seem to keep the cats out.\" There are some who might argue that Cairo, with its noise, its traffic, its pollution and its exasperating but cheerful inefficiency, has gone to the dogs. But those who know this city recognise the absurdity of such a statement. Cairo, they will tell you, long ago went to the cats.<br><br>Consider:<br><br>* Cats prowl the corridors of power in the Foreign Ministry, where they can be seen after hours lounging on the delicately carved, gilt antique settees in the diplomatic waiting rooms.<br><br>* Cats cavort on stage at the National Theatre, where more than once they have upstaged a mediocre performance, to the chagrin of the performers if not of the delighted audience.<br><br>* Cats routinely slip past the security at Cairo Airport, mingling with the passengers in the departure lounges and occasionally stowing away on an outbound flight.<br><br>\"Cats are very much a part of life in Cairo,\" observed a longtime resident who recently adopted the cat that kept following her into the lift. \"Egyptians don't much care for dogs, but they pretty much let cats do as they please.\"<br><br>No-one really knows how many cats there are in Cairo, but they can be found just about everywhere. There are city cats that prowl the back alleys, socialise among the rubbish and, when the weather is nice, lounge on the roofs of parked cars. There are river cats that hunt mice, rats and other small game along the banks of the Nile. There are even desert cats that live on the Giza plateau and that can frequently be found sunning themselves on the summits of the pyramids. Indeed, so ubiquitous are the cats of Cairo that, as this story is written, one is sitting in the writer's lap.<br><br>\"No-one knows how many cats there are in Cairo because there are far too many of them to count,\" Boulous Malek, a veterinarian and Egypt's leading expert on rabies, said recently. \"In my house alone, we have three or four permanent residents living on the landings and several more in the garden.\"<br><br>Malek estimates that there must be \"five or six cats for every house in Cairo, at the very least\". Does this mean there are too many cats in Cairo?<br><br>\"Some might say that,\" Malek said, \"but those who do should remember that without this many cats, Cairo would have a lot more rats.\"Anyone familiar with feline history knows that Egyptians were the first people cats chose to associate with about 4,000 years ago. From the cats'point of view, the relationship was put in its proper perspective from the outset: Egyptians worshipped them.<br><br>Cats were considered sacred for their eyes which, because they glowed in the dark, were believed to hold the light of the sun and to keep evil spirits away during the night.<br><br>Cats are also esteemed, if not revered, in much of the Muslim world. Mohammed is said to have had a cat. According to legend, the reason cats always land on their feet, never on their backs, is because Mohammed used to stroke his cat on the back, thereby charming it.<br><br>Today, cats are not held in the same high regard as they once were. Although Cairo, with its dogs, cats, sheep, camels, horses and donkeys, is more of a menagerie than most large cities, few Egyptians own a pet or think of animals as anything other than beasts of burden or a source of protein.<br><br>\"In general, Egyptians are not pet lovers,\" Malek lamented. \"Those who do have them, don't take very good care of them.\" There are exceptions, of course.<br><br>\"One of my clients,\" Malek said, \"is a woman who owns 12 cats, and every time one of them doesn't eat for a day she thinks it is dying. She will call four veterinarians to her house at the same time, often in the middle of the night.\"<br><br>Perhaps Egypt's best-known cat lover is Hassan Fathy, the internationally renowned architect, who lives in a meticulously restored Islamic-era apartment.<br><br>\"I have 20, maybe 30, cats,\" Fathy once told an interviewer. \"It all depends on who shows up for dinner that day.\"<br><br>The US Embassy in Cairo also keeps cats, although the ambassador may or may not know it. Secretaries take turns sneaking out to feed them.<br><br>Occasionally, one reads in Egyptian newspapers that an airliner has been forced to return to Cairo because of cats in the cabin. Two years ago, an Egyptair Airbus was grounded for two days while airline personnel tried unsuccessfully to coax a feline stowaway out of the cabin. But Cairo's most famous cats are the cats of the Gomhuria Theatre. These musical cats have been known, on more than one occasion, to add their unique accompaniment to the arias from La Traviata.<br><br>But top theatrical honours go to the cat that appeared on stage a few years ago during a piano recital. No-one can recall who the pianist was or what he played, but the cat is widely remembered.<br><br>Appearing on stage after the pianist's concentration had already been broken by the sound of a slamming door and a loudly ringing telephone, the cat crept up to the piano and, evidently fascinated by the quick movement of the pianist's fingers, leapt on to the keyboard. The pianist, clearly no cat lover, stood up, bowed briskly and stalked off the stage, leaving the cat to bask in the applause of the delighted audience. "

    "title": "Historic day of peace dawns on Middle East",
    "text": "For a party not present at the courtship, the United States is throwing one heck of a wedding. About 3,000 people are expected to jam the south lawn of the White House today to witness the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.<br><br>Millions more will watch the historic reconciliation of these bitter foes on live television in 100 countries. Both Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO chief Yasser Arafat will attend the ceremony.<br><br>Although lesser figures are to sign the peace accord, supporters of the agreement hope the spectacle of Rabin and Arafat on the same podium will serve the same function as the late Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 - to help shatter the psychological preconceptions that have long prevented peace in the Middle East and provide momentum to overcome the likely obstacles to implementing the accord.<br><br>\"I am hopeful that this will lead to peace,\" said Arafat, whose arrival Sunday afternoon at Andrews Air Force Base had many onlookers pinching themselves in disbelief.<br><br>Unlike the Sadat trip, which won adulation in the West but was widely condemned in the Arab world, the Israeli-Palestinian agreement might actually lead to the comprehensive peace that has so long eluded the region.<br><br>Jordan and Israel are ready to sign a framework for a peace treaty at the State Department on Tuesday. And breakthroughs with Syria and Lebanon, with which Israel has also been negotiating for nearly two years, should be easier to achieve.<br><br>For now, the spotlight is directed toward what has long been considered the irreconcilable core of the Arab- Israeli conflict: the century-old struggle between Arabs and Jews over who has the right to the historic land of Palestine.<br><br>The actual accord, reached in months of secret negotiations in Norway, promises self-rule for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho by spring, with autonomy to be extended to other Palestinian towns and villages by next summer.<br><br>Negotiations to determine the final status of the territories Israel captured in the 1967 war are to start in two years. The most contentious issues - the fate of Jerusalem and Israeli settlers in the territories and whether there will be a Palestinian state - are left to this final phase.<br><br>Rabin said Sunday that his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, would sign the accord for Israel. Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the PLO's political department and with Peres an architect of the agreement, is expected to sign for the Palestinians. Arafat had hoped that he and Rabin would be the signatories. But Israeli officials said Rabin, having gone so far in recognizing an organization that has been synonymous with anti-Israel terrorism, did not want to give Arafat the appearance of being an equal chief of state.<br><br>Asked in an interview on CNN if he would shake the PLO leader's hand, Rabin at first dodged the question and then only grudgingly replied, \"If it will be needed.\"<br><br>Rabin planned to return to Israel a few hours after the signing, obliging the White House to cancel a planned dinner with Arafat. Instead the PLO leader will borrow a tactic of American politicians and appear on Larry King Live on CNN. Among those expected to witness the signing ceremony will be former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George Bush, who both played significant roles in promoting Middle East peace. The agreement is to be signed on the table used at Camp David on Sept. 17, 1978, to seal the agreement between Israel and Egypt that led to the first, and until today only, peace treaty between Israel and an Arab state. Half a dozen foreign ministers, scores of other diplomats, nearly the entire membership of Congress, leaders of Jewish and Arab-American organizations and assorted presidential friends will also be present. There is no doubt, however, that the White House guest who will attract the most attention will be the PLO leader.<br><br>Known for his checkered headdress, green combat fatigues and a clipped salt-and-pepper beard that in photographs appears to be stubble, Arafat has often appeared to be almost a caricature of himself.<br><br>In his last visit to the United States, in 1974, he addressed the United Nations with a gun on his hip. On his arrival Sunday, he was wearing a formal military uniform but the gun was gone.<br><br>Today, according to his aides, not only will he be unarmed but he will wear something he has never worn in public appearances before - a business suit.<br><br>Putting his fate in the hands of the Secret Service, Arafat was brought by helicopter to his Washington hotel. Decoy limousines arrived at the entrance, where dozens of Arab-Americans waited with Palestinian flags. The PLO, founded in 1964, has been responsible for some of the world's most horrific terrorist acts, such as the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Palestinians also have suffered greatly in the conflict. Hundreds died when Israeli soldiers permitted Lebanese militia to slaughter the inhabitants of Sabra and Chatila, two Beirut refugee camps, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel commandos have assassinated PLO leaders, including PLO co- founder Khalil al-Wazir.<br><br>Although the PLO gradually changed its tactics after the Lebanon debacle and in 1988 declared its desire for a negotiated solution with Israel, for many Israelis and American Jews, the sight of Arafat at the White House may still be too much to bear.<br><br>For Arab-Americans and others who have long argued that Israel had to someday sit down with the PLO, it may seem too good to be true.<br><br>\"To think of Arafat as a legitimate interlocutor of the state of Israel is a rather traumatic event,\" said Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress and a supporter of the accord. \"People are concerned about whether this is for real.\"<br><br>At Arafat's Washington hotel, where a Jewish wedding was just ending as the PLO delegation arrived, many of the guests were apprehensive but elated. \"It's scary but the potential is so exciting, like a marriage,\" said the bride, Barbara Tannenbaum Epstein, originally from Lake City, as a band played the Jewish song To Life in the background. \"It's a perfect day and a wonderful opportunity.\""

    "text": "CAIRO - Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat, in a thinly veiled and highly unorthodox endorsement of the Israeli Labor Party, has urged Arab citizens of Israel to participate in their country's Nov. 1 elections.<br><br>Arafat's comments, reported by Egypt's Middle East News Agency, came at a press conference in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, where he and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew Sunday from Jordan following a summit with Jordanian King Hussein.<br><br>The consultations in Jordan also seemed intended to bolster the Labor Party by reviving the impression of cooperation between the PLO and Jordan, whose ties have been severely strained, and by resurrecting the idea of a ''federation'' between Jordan and a Palestinian homeland.<br><br>Upon returning to Cairo, Mubarak was quoted as saying that Arafat had agreed to such a confederation.<br><br>However, Saad Kamel, a PLO representative in Egypt who also took part in the Jordan talks, said no agreement on this sensitive matter had been reached and a decision would be left to a meeting next month of the Palestine National Council, an informal parliament representing Palestinians around the world.<br><br>Hussein, who barely three months ago drew back from peace diplomacy and essentially dared the PLO to achieve its aims without him, said only that he and Arafat had agreed ''to continue contacts to coordinate positions in the service of the Palestinian cause.''<br><br>Egypt, the only Arab nation to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, sought the Hussein-Arafat summit to revive the so-called ''Jordan option'' that is advocated by the Israeli Labor Party. Arab moderates prefer Labor to the rival Likud bloc because Labor is willing to participate in an international peace conference on the Middle East and to relinquish some of the territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war.<br><br>In contrast, Likud has vowed not to give up an inch of the West Bank of the Jordan River, which was part of the ancient kingdom of Israel.<br><br>At his news conference, Arafat announced that the PLO had issued two ''important statements'' to Israeli voters. One urged Arabs living within the pre-1967 borders of Israel, who have the right to vote unlike those in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, to take part in the parliamentary elections to ''push forward the peace process.''<br><br>The second statement, addressed to Jewish voters, asked them to choose between war and peace. It noted that leaders of the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza had so far refrained from using firearms and promised continued restraint ''to show the Israeli citizens that the way of peace and not of war and bloodshed is best for our children.''<br><br>Taken with several other recent developments, some of them coordinated with the Labor Party, the PLO appeals represent an unprecedented Arab intrusion into Israeli domestic politics.<br><br>Arab officials admitted there was a danger that their efforts could backfire and drive voters to Likud, but they said this was a risk they were willing to take.<br><br>''We want the Israeli voter, whether Arab or Jew, to understand where his specific interest lies,'' said Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's chief foreign policy adviser. ''Let him know when he casts his vote that there is an Arab partner ready for negotiations.''"

    "title": "Terror reigns on hijacked jet's flight to Cyprus",
    "text": "CAIRO, Egypt - With almost no fuel left and the passengers said to be in such panic that many were vomiting, a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet landed in Cyprus Friday after the pilot, pleading for mercy, radioed that he was going to be forced to crash into the sea.<br><br>The airliner, hijacked Tuesday by terrorists seeking the release of Shiite Moslem militants imprisoned in Kuwait, had taken off earlier in the day from Mashhad airport in northeastern Iran on what for some 50 hostages still on board was to be a terror-filled odyssey across the Middle East in search of an airport willing to let them land.<br><br>\"Thank you, thank you. I'll never forget this,\" the pilot said in a voice choked with emotion as Cypriot officials finally relented and cleared the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 for landing at Larnaca Airport, where it touched down Friday evening, reportedly with only a few minutes of fuel left in its tanks.<br><br>Cypriot authorities immediately cordoned off the airport, declared a state of emergency and suspended all other air traffic. Foreign Minister George Iacovou went to Larnaca to establish contact with the hijackers, who have not identified themselves but are believed to be Lebanese Shiite Moslems. Passengers freed earlier in Iran have given different estimates for the number of hijackers, but there are said to be at least five and perhaps as many as seven.<br><br>In London, 18 freed British hostages got an emotional greeting from their families and an official government welcome when they landed at Heathrow Airport, The Associated Press reported.<br><br>They were brought home by a British Airways jet diverted from Dubai to Kuwait to pick them up.<br><br>\"Everyone was charging around the lounge trying to find their family,\" said Mark Appleby, 23. He was returning from a vacation in Thailand with his sister Nicola and family friend Sue Silcock, 21, when the plane was hijacked. \"There was a lot of hugging,\" Appleby said.<br><br>Some passengers, looking pale and drawn, left the airport quickly after the reunion, escorted by police, government officials and airport security to their cars. Some leaned on the arms of relatives.<br><br>Scott Stillwell, a 23-year-old photographer, said: \"We weren't harmed. They seemed very well-trained. I don't think they are afraid to die.\" The gunmen commandeered the Kuwait-bound aircraft several hours after it took off Tuesday from Bangkok and diverted it to Mashhad, where over the next three days they released 57 of the 112 people on board. The remaining hostages are said to include 30 Kuwaitis and a number of other Arabs. Among the Kuwaiti hostages are three members of Kuwait's ruling al Sabah family. Iranian authorities, who at Kuwait's request had refused to allow the plane to leave Mashhad, relented Friday morning and gave the pilot clearance to take off after the hijackers threw a hand grenade onto the runway and beat one of the passengers in front of the cockpit radio so his screams could be heard by officials in the control tower.<br><br>For the weary Iraqi pilot and his remaining passengers, the hours that followed turned into a daylong nightmare in which the terror of one moment was quickly eclipsed by the horror of the next. As one airport after another denied it permission to land, the plane flew west across Iran and Turkey to Cyprus, where it initially was turned away. Circling, it then sought permission to land in Beirut or Damascus, Syria, but again was denied permission to land.By the time the jet landed at Larnaca, a little more than seven hours after leaving Iran, the pilot reported that his fuel gauges showed \"zero, repeat, zero readings on all tanks.\"<br><br>The most dramatic stage of the flight came as the jet circled Beirut Airport for nearly three hours, with the pilot repeatedly pleading for permission to land. But the monitored radio conversations between the plane and the control tower indicated that Lebanese officials and Syrian military authorities, whose troops control the airport, were adamant in their refusal.<br><br>\"If you try to land by force, you will be fired upon,\" the control tower warned.<br><br>\"A gun is pointed at my head. I request landing permission to refuel,\" the pilot said.<br><br>\"We (Lebanese) have been for 14 years under gunfire,\" the traffic controller answered coldly, still refusing to let the plane land.<br><br>\"Please, please. I beg you, I kiss your hand,\" the pilot said. \"I have human lives at stake here. If you don't let me land, I will have to crash into the sea.\"<br><br>\"Do whatever you want,\" the voice from the control tower replied. \"Crash on the tarmac or in the sea. We will not let you land here.\" At one point, the plane suddenly began to dive toward the control tower, sending people on the ground running in panic. But it pulled up at the last minute.<br><br>It was at that point, apparently, that officials in Larnaca, 25 minutes' flying time away, relented and radioed their approval for the jumbo jet to land."

    "text": "CAIRO - Worshipped as a god and then admired for thousands of years as one of man's most wondrous creations, the Great Sphinx of Egypt still looks impressive when seen from afar.<br><br>Viewed from up close, the massive statue with the lion's body and the pharaoh's face inspires pity more than awe.<br><br>Its noseless visage appears battered and bludgeoned. One eye is blurry, and its upper lip is mostly gone. Its body is a hodge-podge of repair jobs, old and modern. If the Sphinx could talk, it might ask to be buried in sand again and left alone. As a symbol of the grandeur that was Egypt and one of the premier tourist attractions of the country today, the Sphinx has not been allowed that luxury. Instead, it has become something of a political controversy and an archaeologists' guinea pig.<br><br>In ancient Greek mythology, the Sphinx was a frightful creature that devoured travelers who failed to answer a riddle. Egypt's version has proved dangerous to directors of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization who failed to solve the mystery of the 4,600-year-old monument's accelerating deterioration.<br><br>The latest victim, Ahmed Kadry, was fired last month after a 500-pound piece of the Sphinx's right shoulder broke loose and tumbled to the ground.<br><br>While the main reason for his removal was said by insiders to be personal animosity with the new minister of culture, the pretext had precedent and a nice historical irony. Kadry got his job in 1981 after his predecessor was made to take the blame for the collapse of part of the Sphinx's left hind paw.<br><br>Then as now, a great hue and cry went up in the Egyptian media and a new campaign to ''save the Sphinx'' was hastily mounted. For the next six years, stones from previous restorations dating back to 700 B.C. were removed from the lower portion of the statue and replaced with hundreds of new limestone blocks. Before the work was halted last December, the venerable creature's paws, rump and tail were entirely encased in new stones. Reaction to the work among many foreign experts and Egyptians not involved in the project was scathing.<br><br>''It's awful-looking,'' said a senior member of one of the half-dozen Western archaeological institutes in Cairo. ''Those stones would look better on a bank.'' Aesthetic complaints aside, the reconstruction did not address, and may have aggravated, the underlying causes for the Sphinx's deterioration.<br><br>The statue has never had much immunity, experts say, because it was made from weak material. While the adjacent pyramids were built on top of the Giza plateau from rugged limestone blocks, the Sphinx was hewn by the architects of the Pharaoh Chephren from a piece of the plateau itself, left in the middle of a quarry at the plateau's edge. The rock is among the world's oldest, perhaps 50-million years old, and is composed of three geological layers. The Sphinx's midsection is particularly fragile, a club sandwich of soft and hard limestone that has eroded at different rates, giving the body a wavy profile. The 100-ton head is composed of harder stone, and experts have long worried that it might topple from the statue's decaying neck. Repair jobs were repeatedly done in ancient times through the early Christian era. Then for centuries, under ensuing Moslem governments, the Sphinx was largely ignored and preserved by being buried in the sand. Fully excavated for the first time in the 1920s, it has been succumbing in recent years to a process calledefflorescence that is also attacking many other Egyptian monuments.<br><br>Excessive moisture - perhaps due to the Aswan High Dam, which has raised the water table all over Egypt, perhaps as a result of local overpopulation and non-existent sewers - is sucked into the statue, where it dissolves salts. The salty solution is then drawn to the surface, where it recrystallizes, undermining surface stones, which eventually crumble into dust.<br><br>Cement used to join the limestone blocks in the latest restoration has probably added to the salt problem, said Zahi Hawass, the new director of antiquities for the Giza plateau.<br><br>''The Sphinx has cancer,'' he said. ''If you add new stones, the cancer is still inside the Sphinx.'' Dr. Hawass heads a new committee of Egyptian and foreign experts charged with saving the statue. They have tentatively decided to put back the piece of the shoulder that fell with metal rods, of stainless steel or titanium. They hope to control the level of the water under the Sphinx through the use of existing wells. Dr. Hawass said the local authorities had also agreed on the need to build a sewer system for the village of souvenir sellers that has developed a few hundred yards from the Sphinx.<br><br>This campaign, he vowed, would succeed where the previous ones had failed. ''Everything is going as we want it now,'' he said.<br><br>Other Sphinx lovers are crossing their fingers. ''Face is more important than fact in this country,'' said a foreign archaeologist who has worked for many years in Egypt. ''Everything becomes personalized and politicized. A piece of the Sphinx falls, the chickens start flapping their wings, the feathers fly and a whole new Sphinx is created without the advice of a single art historian.''<br><br>He regarded the inclusion of foreign experts in the new campaign as encouraging - the previous work was exclusively Egyptian - but warned that it could also be a future source of political controversy. While hundreds of Egyptians have become students of their past in recent decades, foreigners continue to dominate Egyptology, which was, after all, a foreign invention. The first Egyptologists were scientists who accompanied Napoleon on the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. They were followed by scores of others who ranged from dedicated scholars to treasure hunters and plunderers.<br><br>Mindful of their checkered past, foreign archaeologists working in Egypt today are careful not to criticize local colleagues on the record or to assume too high a profile for their discoveries.<br><br>Two years ago, when a British-Dutch expedition uncovered a tomb that a British reporter inaccurately described as ''the most important'' since the Englishman Howard Carter opened the tomb of Tutankhamen in 1922, Egyptian authorities bristled and a columnist in the government-owned magazine Al Mussawar wrote a diatribe against foreign archaeological missions which, he charged, ''have spread like a cancer over the land of Egypt.'' Ahmed Kadry, now criticized for failing to use foreign help to restore the Sphinx, was previously attacked for allowing foreigners to test new theories and equipment - for example, letting two French architects drill several small holes in the Great Pyramid of Cheops.<br><br>''The problem is that some countries are extremely rich in terms of cultural heritage but not so rich in economic and technical resources,'' said Luis Monreal, director of the California-based Getty Conservation Institute, which is restoring the 3,200-year-old tomb of Nefertari in upper Egypt, another project started under Kadry's administration.<br><br>''There are probably no more than 5,000 properly trained conservators in the world,'' Monreal added. ''That's as though you had one bed for 10-million sick people. The great dilemma for the 21st century is that all this heritage cannot be preserved.''"

    "text": "China and the United States announced a historic accord Tuesday to reduce arms sales to Taiwan, but Peking swiftly warned the arms dispute still 'clouds' Sino-U.S. relations and could provoke a crisis unless sales end entirely.<br><br>'The agreement reached between the governments of China and the United States on the question of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan marks only a beginning of the settlement of this issue,' a statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry said within minutes of the announcement.<br><br>'It is evident that failure to settle this issue is bound to seriously impair relations between the two countries.' The agreement, announced simultaneously in Washington and Peking, pledged Washington would gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan, which Peking considers a renegade province. China also pledged its moves to reunify the island with the mainland would be peaceful.<br><br>Hours before the communique was made public, diplomatic sources said, U.S Ambassador Arthur Hummel Jr. met with Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping, China's most powerful leader.<br><br>But almost immediately, there were signs of a possible disagreement over language that said the United States 'intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution.'<br><br>American officials indicated they believed that meant Taiwan would continue being supplied until it is peacefully reunified with China. But a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the 'final resolution referred to here certainly implies that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan must be completely terminated over a period of time.'<br><br>Diplomatic sources said the Chinese were clearly pleased with the outcome of 10 months of difficult and secret negotiations. And the swift Foreign Ministry warning and an equally tough editorial by the Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily, were seen as attempts to make the compromises more palatable to party hardliners. Explaining why China dropped its demand for an immediate, total cutoff of arms to Taiwan, a foreign ministry official borrowed a phrase from former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger -- saying China realized the dispute was so difficult it had to be solved by 'step-by-step' diplomacy.<br><br>The People's Daily editorial warned the communique was only a first step.<br><br>'The clouds hanging over Sino-U.S. relations have not been completely cleared away,' it said. 'The United States has made several promises but what it will actually do in the future remains to be seen.'<br><br>Officials would not say if Deng personally participated in the negotiations that led to the accord, but diplomatic sources said the Chinese were represented at 'the highest-level.'<br><br>Western diplomats saw the agreement as a gain for Deng, who evidently managed to neutralize opposition to the accord at secret leadership meetings held two weeks ago to prepare for a Communist Party congress opening Sept. 1.<br><br>The congress, the first in five years, is expected to rubber stamp Deng's modernization reforms, his renovation of the party power structure and his choice of younger leaders to fill posts occupied by aging cadres.<br><br>While all the important decisions have already been made, failure to resolve the Taiwan dispute before the party congress could have been used against Deng by hardliners opposed to his reforms, diplomats said."

    "title": "PLO says it will accept Israel",
    "text": "ALGIERS, Algeria - The Palestinian leadership has decided to abide by majority rule and will endorse a key United Nations resolution recognizing Israel's right to exist, Palestinian officials said Sunday.<br><br>The officials said the leaders of all main factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), with the exception of the hard-line Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), had agreed on this step. The leaders were nearing a compromise on the final wording of a political statement to be issued this week along with a declaration of an independent Palestinian state.<br><br>The political statement, officials said, will call for an international Middle East peace conference on the basis of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242. The resolution, passed after the 1967 Middle East War, asks Israel to give up territory captured in that war in return for a guarantee of its right to exist within secure borders.<br><br>The statement will also ask for a guarantee of a Palestinian right to statehood, which was not mentioned in Resolution 242. Officials acknowledged that the language will not fully satisfy the longstanding U.S. position, which opposes an independent Palestinian state and rejects many U.N. resolutions as virulently anti-Israel.<br><br>But they said they hoped the statement would go far enough to sway Western public opinion and persuade the administration of President-elect George Bush to adopt a more sympathetic policy toward the Palestinian cause.<br><br>''I think the United States will find that many of its conditions have been met,'' said Jamil Hilal, the official spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).<br><br>On Sunday night, the Democratic Front leader, Nayef Hawatmeh, said that some differences continued over whether the political statement should mention by number U.N. resolutions that guarantee the right of Palestinians displaced in four Middle East conflicts to return to their homes or receive compensation. But the Democratic Front seemed ready to reach a compromise with the largest PLO faction, the Fatah group of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. George Habash, chief of the Popular Front, was alone among the leaders in refusing to give up his resistance to mention Resolution 242. But he agreed not to walk out of the conference or splinter the Palestinian movement, PLO officials said. Instead, he is expected to enter his reservations on the record and allow the Palestine National Council (PNC), an informal parliament, to proceed on the basis of majority rule. ''Habash told the PNC that he would not give Israel the gift of splitting the PLO over 242,'' a PLO official said.<br><br>The political statement is also expected to renounce acts of terrorism and to endorse the so-called Cairo Declaration issued by Arafat in November 1985. That declaration was made in the aftermath of the hijacking of an Italian cruise ship, the Achille Lauro, and the murder of an elderly American passenger. It states that the PLO would confine future acts of violence to military targets within Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank of Jordan and Gaza Strip. In recent years, Arafat has personally endorsed Resolution 242 coupled with Palestinian self-determination. But the PNC - which includes representatives of the main PLO factions as well as Palestinian communities outside Israel - has never done so.<br><br>''This PNC will legislate the line that has been presented by Chairman Arafat since a very long time,'' said Bassam Abusherif, a top adviser to Arafat. ''The line calling for a just peace in the Middle East.''<br><br>Some PLO moderates expressed disappointment that acceptance of 242 is likely to be muddied by the Palestinian leadership's decision to refer to other U.N. resolutions in its statement. But they stressed that it isstill a watershed for a movement that at its founding in 1964 was dedicated to the disappearance of the Jewish state.<br><br>The declaration of independence, they added, is meant to boost morale of the 1.7-million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who for nearly a year have been fighting Israeli military occupation with little more than sticks and stones.<br><br>It is this intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic, that has done more than any PNC declaration or PLO manifesto to increase popular sympathy for the Palestinians and to revive interest by Western governments in pursuing a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict."

While major allies withheld official comment beyond pro forma congratulations to the president-elect, privately their reactions were mixed and tinged with doubts over whether America becomes more or less isolationist under GOP stewardship.<br><br>The only nations openly greeting Reagan's election with relief were rightists in Latin America and Asia, whose regimes have been sweating under the heat of President Carter's human rights campaign.<br><br>In Western Europe, hopes that Reagan will infuse a new sense of leadership into the flagging alliance were tempered by fears that he understands little of East-West and economic issues and is not predisposed toward detente.<br><br>In the Middle East, both Israeli and Arab officials saw Reagan's victory as being to Israel's advantage. Camp David was Carter's biggest foreign policy triumph and Egyptians asked whether Reagan would have the same interest in continuing the process.<br><br>The Soviet Union hinted it could react either way in a commentary pledging to pursue 'good relations' with Washington, but stressing the extent to which this depends on ratification of the SALT II treaty criticized by Reagan.<br><br>Analysts also noted Reagan's election may not be unwelcomed by the deeply conservative Soviet leadership, which seems to prefer conservative American presidents. For them, President Carter was an unreliable partner, Richard Nixon was not.<br><br>Among America's NATO allies, whose governments are preoccupied by security issues, politicians found themselves caught between a desire to see a stronger America capable of checking Soviet ambitions and their fears of a return to confrontation politics. The French reaction typified this ambivalence.<br><br>Michel Poniatowski, a close adviser to President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said he felt 'a reaction of relief.' The United States, he said, 'lost these last few years a great deal of its power, bringing about an increasing imbalance to the detriment of the United States vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.'<br><br>But another senior French official said bluntly: 'Reagan understands nothing.'<br><br>Specific nations faced with major problems that at one time or another became issues in the campaign all tried to assess what a Reagan presidency will mean for them.<br><br>Iran said it would not affect the ordeal of America's 52 hostages, held for 368 days. 'The conditions for the release of the hostages are unchanged. For us it makes no difference who governs the USA,' said Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai.<br><br>China, which bitterly criticized Reagan's campaign promise to restore official links with Taiwan, skipped over even pro forma congratulations in a frosty communique that bluntly warned him against harming Sino- American relations.<br><br>Nationalist Chinese officials on Tawain, by contrast, were so elated they broke with tradition by commenting on an American election for the first time since 1949. 'We are gratified to learn that Mr. Reagan has beenelected and this is the expression of U.S. public opinion,' a statement said.<br><br>Other warm messages of support came from South Korea and Haiti, both ruled by right-wing regimes, and from rightists in Guatemala and El Salvador, where Reagan's victory set off a night-long celebration of shooting.<br><br>'Reagan's election will intimidate the leftist subversives. They are spoiled children and now they have someone to spank them,' said a spokesman for El Salvador's far-right Broad National Front.<br><br>In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states issued non-committal statements while the Palestine Libertion Organization said, 'the curse of the Palestinian people' fell upon Carter as it does 'all those who plot against its just cause and inalienable rights.'<br><br>Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat both expressed interest in meeting Reagan as soon as possible -- Begin when he is in the United States next week on a private visit.<br><br>Sadat continued to press for a three-way summit with Begin and Reagan and Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Ali said he hoped to go to Washington next month to work out the details with the president-elect.<br><br>It was also Sadat who, of all America's allies, praised President Carter the most eloquently.<br><br>'Peace upon Carter the day he was elected,' the Egyptian president said. 'Peace upon him the day we worked with him. And peace upon him the day he carries out the will of his people and retires.'"

    "text": "To educated Arabs, it has long been a cause for sad irony that their region, which spawned the world's first great civilizations, is today so far behind the West in political development.<br><br>Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Iraq's predecessor, gave rise to organized agriculture, writing and even the first monotheistic religion, worship of the sun god Akhenaton in Egypt. The Middle East also produced the three great religions that persist today - Judaism, Christianity and Islam. During the Middle Ages, when Europeans were little better than barbarians, high culture flourished under Moslem dynasties, and cities such as Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad were like today's Paris, New York and Tokyo rolled into one. Arab scholars, fluent in Greek, in which the wisdom of the ancients had been preserved, developed and eventually passed on this knowledge to Europe, raising the curtain on the Dark Ages and inspiring the European Renaissance.<br><br>So why did the Middle East fall behind the West and why has it failed to catch up? Arab leaders put a large part of the blame on outside forces, a tendency that despite its considerable validity has made it more difficult for them to recognize their own failings and do something about them.<br><br>The beginning of the Middle East's comparative downfall dates to the Ottoman Turks, who reunified the region in the 16th century but who succumbed to decadence and lost their military edge.<br><br>Napoleon's French infantrymen, employing the height of contemporary military science, stunned the Turkish horsemen defending Egypt at the turn of the 18th century and only withdrew when defeated in a celebrated naval battle by the other European superpower of the time, Britain.<br><br>From the late 1800s through much of this century, the British and the French largely partitioned the Arab world, influencing it through alliances, outright colonization or so-called mandates. Only in the period between the two world wars did Arab nations begin to gain independence on paper. But the boundaries were drawn by foreigners - Jordan, it is said, was created by Winston Churchill one day over breakfast - and the sense of nationhood has remained fragile particularly in the countries sitting atop the vast oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.<br><br>Ruled in essence by one extended family, the Sabahs, from 1756 until the Iraqi invasion last week, Kuwait has had formal independence only since 1961.<br><br>The fluid nature of boundaries in the sands of the Arabian peninsula tempted Iraq to contest Kuwaiti claims at that time. The Iraqis backed off when Britain deployed troops. But Iraq and Kuwait never reached a formal agreement on their border. The Iraqi strongman, Saddam Hussein, has long coveted two islands at the top of the Persian Gulf as well as Kuwait's oil reserves.<br><br>While outsiders can be blamed for drawing artificial boundaries, many of the governments within those boundaries have so far failed to instill a strong sense of national identity among their populations. This has been particularly true in the Persian Gulf states, where natives are sometimes in the minority and most of the work is done by Palestinians, Pakistanis and Filipinos who lack rights of citizenship.<br><br>Even for the natives, there is no democracy as such but an archaic system of tribal consultation and patronage in the case of the rich oil states, and of dictatorship or fake parliamentary democracy almost everywhere else. \"\"The immense havoc Saddam could wreak derives from the fragility of the whole Middle Eastern interstate system to which he has just dealt such a stunning blow, from the degeneracy of most of its regimes and the despair and disillusionment of its people,'' wrote David Hirst, an expert on the region and longtime correspondent for the Guardian newspaper. It is impossible to foretell what effect Iraq's aggression - the first outright invasion of one Arab state by another in modern times ill have on the region as a whole or on such complex disputes as the Arab-Israeli conflict. But if it disabuses Arabs of the notion that the rest of the world is to blame for their failings and of the vain hope that one day an Arab leader will come along to unify and save them, then it may do the Middle East a service in the long run."

'Please,' she said, pressing a letter into the hands of a stranger before vanishing into the night.<br><br>The letter, addressed to the U.N. General Assembly, was in classical Tibetan script. The stranger, one of a group of foreign correspondents visiting Lhasa this week, had just had his first contact with a Tibetan dissident. The journalists were invited to Lhasa by the Chinese government to report on the changes that have taken place since 1980, when Peking embarked on a program to restore the religious freedom it previously had suppressed and to raise the primitive living standards of Tibet's 1.89 million inhabitants.<br><br>Although the program has made noticeable progress, fear and animosity still separate the Tibetan people from the Chinese who conquered them 33 years ago.<br><br>On a six-day visit it was impossible to measure the depth and extent of opposition to Chinese rule. But the similar experiences of several correspondents suggests a situation far removed from the rosy picture of Chinese-Tibetan relations painted by Chinese propaganda.<br><br>It suggests that a discreet but well-organized opposition exists, fueled by anti-Chinese feeling and inspired by the exiled Dalai Lama, Tibet's revered religious leader who fled to India 24 years ago after an abortive uprising.<br><br>The shows of opposition range from clandestine appeals pressed into the hands of foreigners strolling the mazelike streets of old Lhasa to occasional reports of violence.<br><br>Foreigners familiar with Tibetan affairs said they were told by a high-ranking Chinese source that seven Chinese were pulled off a bus on a remote mountain road in southern Tibet last spring and hanged by a group of Tibetans who have yet to be caught.<br><br>China will not disclose the figures, but the number of its Peoples Liberation Army troops is massive. Guards with fixed bayonets are posted at bridges leading to the city and soldiers regularly patrol the old Tibetan quarter of the city.<br><br>'The PLA is here more for the control of the local population than for guarding China's borders,' said one Western expert on Tibet. Two Tibetan dissidents said the Chinese still hold 2,500 political prisoners -- 500 in Lhasa and 2,000 in the rest of Tibet, which is larger in area than Britain, France and Italy combined.<br><br>'The feeling of separation exists,' an official of the local Tibetan government conceded to reporters. 'But it is a minority and mostly it is anarchism. By anarchism, I mean people who don't observe the relevant regulations and discipline, people who don't like to work and alcoholics.'<br><br>Although a guerrilla-style underground does not appear to exist, reporters encountered much evidence of widespread anti-Chinese feeling and of a loose but effective network of dissidents who appear to have links with the Dalai Lama's organization in Dharmsala, India, 900 miles away.<br><br>This network is held together by two sentiments: reverence for the Dalai Lama, who the majority of Tibetans still believe is their only rightful ruler, and hatred of the Chinese, who invaded in 1950 to enforce a claim that dates back to the 7th century when King Srongsten Gampo took a Chinese princess as one of his three wives.<br><br>Far from being eliminated by the systematic destruction of more than 2,000 monasteries during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Tibetan Buddhism seems only to have been tempered by previous Chinese attempts toeradicate it.<br><br>Signs of reverence for the Dalai Lama and hatred of the Chinese are everywhere.<br><br>Most Tibetans wear silver or brass amulets, carry prayer wheels and have pictures of the Dalai Lama to show their devotion to Buddhism and the spiritual leader they revere as a living God-King.<br><br>Pilgrims walk clockwise around the Jokhang, the most important temple in Tibet, singing sutras and spinning prayer wheels. The devout prostrate themselves for hours in front of the golden-roofed temple, chanting the holy words 'Om Mani Padme Hum,' (Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus). During strolls, reporters were approached constantly by Tibetans seeking to pass on secret appeals or whisper words of discontent.<br><br>'The Chinese do not belong here. We support the Dalai Lama,' one middle-aged woman whispered. Another woman conceded to reporters that China's Deng Xiaoping was 'the leader of our country.' But asked who was higher, Deng or the Dalai Lama, she replied without hesitation: 'the Dalai Lama.'<br><br>China has tried to calm feelings of separatism by reducing its presence in Tibet over the past two years, removing as many as 20,000 Chinese civilians.<br><br>But the Chinese realize that the Dalai Lama's exile remains a continuing symbol of separatist feelings and have invited him to return as spiritual leader -- provided he follows China's political line.<br><br>The 49-year-old Dalai Lama has sent five fact-finding missions to Tibet and has said he could return only if he was convinced most Tibetans were happy under Chinese rule.<br><br>Said a Tibetan monk: 'If the Dalai Lama says he will come back only if Tibetans are happy under the Chinese, then the Dalai Lama is never coming back.'

'It cheers me up,' said Jin, who spends most of his time bent over dead bodies.<br><br>Jin is a make-up artist -- but not for the living. He works at the Longhua state crematorium, preparing the faces of the dead for their funerals. In his spare time, Jin is a popular composer. Two of his songs have become nationwide hits in China. Jin, 35, credits his pressures at work with giving him the inspiration to write songs.<br><br>'I've seen so much sadness in my job that it has given me the feeling I should write happy songs,' Jin said in a recent interview at his place of work.<br><br>Jin began composing 10 years ago and more than 80 of his songs have been recorded since then. But his big break came in 1980, when 'Postgirl,' his most popular tune, was broadcast on the radio and quickly sold out in the stores. That was followed by another hit, 'Happy Young People,' in 1981.<br><br>Popular music in China -- that is, music that is officially encouraged to be popular -- tends to be a mixture of clumsy morality and ideological mush with no sex and a heavy emphasis on the virtues of clean socialist living. It is not exactly the stuff that Michael Jackson hits are made of; more like the philosophy of Karl Marx as sung by Pat Boone.<br><br>Jin's music is no exception. 'Postgirl' is a snappy little tune about a female letter-carrier who loves her work and sings about how determined she is to be successful. 'Happy Young People' is full of la-la-las and explains 'why Chinese youth are so happy,' Jin said. Some sample lyrics:<br><br>'...Why am I so happy?<br><br>'Because I love the colorful life. 'I am like a lark in spring, flying into blue skies.<br><br>'I love the ordinary work.'<br><br>'The song is about myself,' Jin said. 'I am doing very ordinary work, but I still find that life is very meaningful.'<br><br>While most of Jin's tunes are upbeat, he has written a few sadder songs such as 'People Who Work in Special Places,' a bittersweet ballad about crematorium workers.<br><br>Despite his success as a composer, Jin says he has no plans to quit the crematorium, where he has worked for the past eight years, to devote all his time to music.<br><br>For one thing, composers don't get paid much in China. Jin gets between $2 and $10 for each song bought by a publisher. For another, as the song says, 'I have learned to love my work,' Jin said.<br><br>That wasn't true in the beginning, however. The first time Jin found himself alone in a room with dead bodies, he froze and had to be rescued by a fellow worker. Single then, Jin also had trouble meeting girls. Dates tended to end as soon as the girl asked him where he worked. Eventually, Jin met someone 'who came to understand the value of my work.' They married in 1980 and nowhave a baby daughter.<br><br>Jin also credits his music with helping him to overcome his fear of working with the dead.<br><br>'When I work I play music in my mind,' he said. 'I do make-up with a musical rhythm.' "

One British correspondent was pressured into reading a statement before Libyan TV cameras denouncing \"false reporting\" because of a story he had written about a shooting incident witnessed by a number of journalists.<br><br>Others found that they could not place phone calls or receive them from their offices to dictate stories.<br><br>This correspondent's office, after trying in vain to call him for several days, got through to the hotel only to be told by the operator that \"we cannot put you through to that room.\"<br><br>Libyan officials denied that any harassment or censorship was involved. \"We only want that you should write the truth,\" one official explained.

    "title": "Godzilla lives! Voracious Japanese monsters stalk vulnerable young American moviegoer",
    "text": "What looks like a lobster dressed in a morning coat, has a sweet tooth for skyscrapers and is named after a popular French singer?<br><br>Any Japanese kid would know the answer but, for the benefit of other readers, the answer is Barutan -- perhaps the most infamous of the current crop of creatures crawling through Japanese monster movies these days. Fans of Godzilla and other low-budget Japanese monster movies - which developed a cult following outside Japan for being so bad they were good -- can take heart. The Japanese monster movie industry is alive and well and just as bad as ever, if not worse.<br><br>What's more, those flesh-eating, fire-breathing, cement-crushing crustaceans may soon be crawling abroad again.<br><br>A Tokyo movie company is about to start filming the first Godzilla movie in nearly 15 years and an affiliate is trying to interest U.S. distributors in a specially-made version of Ultraman, currently the most popular monster movie series in Japan.<br><br>Ultraman and his five beady-eyed, metallic brothers live on the planet M-78 and commute to work on Earth whenever their help is needed in battling the likes of Barutan, Garamon, Mottokureron or the vile Woo, which looks like an abominable snowman with a bad case of overbite.<br><br>This they do with a mixture of flashy karate chops, death-defying leaps and bounds and lots of red, green and yellow smoke that keeps millions of Japanese kids glued to their television sets for 30 minutes most every afternoon.<br><br>Arrayed against them are a gallery of more than 750 fanged, horned and scaly beasts that creep, crawl or crush their way across the urban landscape and seem, for the most part, to be named after foreigners. Barutan, for instance, is named after the way Japanese pronounce French singer Sylvie Vartan's name.<br><br>Ultraman, which celebrates its 20th anniversary next year, is the longest-running TV and movie series in Japan and has spawned a multimillion-dollar spinoff industry in the form of T-shirts, dolls, costumes, records and comic books.<br><br>'Ultraman has had a tremendous social impact in Japan,' says Noboru Tsuburaya, president of the film company that bears his name and was founded by his father, Ultraman's creator.<br><br>'The first generation of kids to watch Ultraman has grown up and now has kids of its own. So Ultraman gives families a basis for communication. Parents can talk to their children about the monsters because they saw the same monsters 20 years ago,' Tsuburaya said. Critics of the genre, including some of the American companies Tsuburaya is trying to interest in Ultraman, say that is precisely the trouble with Japanese monster movies -- the same old monsters, the same old plots and, unfortunately, the same old level of technique.<br><br>Tsuburaya admits that Ultraman's special effects may not be up to the level of 'Star Wars,' 'E.T.' or 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' But he notes that American filmmakers 'spend a lot more time and money' creating such effects and says that if 'we Japanese do the same, we can produce films on the same level.' That they have not done so yet says less about the technical ability of the Japanese film industry than it does about these films' time-tested formula for success and their function as vehicles for the communication of cultural values and mores.For one thing, unlike their American counterparts, Japanese supermen are not individuals, lone crusaders for truth, justice and the Japanese way. Ultraman, Bioman, Dynaman and other Japanese super-heroes work in teams, as members of family groups, teaching youngsters early lessons about the importance of cooperation and conformity in an intensely group- oriented society.<br><br>The individual is the monster -- he who opposes the interests of the group and tries to destroy the social order.

The report did not specify how they were executed, but death by firing squad is the usual method in China.<br><br>Waving knives and dynamite, the five hijackers had tried to commandeer a Soviet-built, Ilyushin-18 turboprop during a domestic flight from Xian in north-central China to the coastal port of Shanghai July 25. They were identified as Sun Yunping, Yan Feng, Gao Keli, Zie Zhimin and Wei Xueli, all in their 20s.<br><br>Overpowered and beaten by passengers and crew, there was no word on the hijackers' fate until Xinhua announced the execution, adding that they had been tried in Shanghai Aug. 10-11. Later Thursday, evening television news showed a film of the hijackers, dressed in blue prison clothes, listening grimly as the judge read their sentence.<br><br>The film dispelled rumors that one or more of the hijackers had been killed by the angry crew and passengers who had beaten them with brooms, bottles and mops as the plane dived from the skies.<br><br>The hijacking attempt was disclosed by China because 19 American tourists were among the 80 passengers aboard. None was injured despite one of the hijackers exploding a stick of dynamite in the plane's bathroom during the melee. The plane's crew and 13 passengers who helped were honored in Peking Thursday by China's CAAC state airline, Xinhua said.<br><br>As 1,200 officials gave them 'thunderous applause,' the crew received certificates, monetary rewards and red silk banners emblazoned with the words 'Heroic CAAC Crew' in gold letters.<br><br>Accepting his award, the pilot, Capt. Yang Jihai, 52, said two thoughts raced through his mind as he leaped from the controls to assault the hijackers: to 'ensure the safe landing of the plane and maintain the prestige of the motherland.'<br><br>Yang was awarded the title of 'anti-hijacking hero' by the government last week. When the scuffle with the hijackers erupted in the cockpit, Xinhua said, he rushed into the passenger section and summoned help by shouting: 'All Communists, stand up and fight the rascals.' "

About half the worshippers at the Nantang and Chongwenmen services appeared to be people under 30 and many were in their teens. Protestant officials estimate 1,500 people -- a third of them under 30 -- regularly attend four weekly services in Peking. While numbers are hard to come by, there are an estimated 4 million Catholics and 1 million Protestants now worshipping publicly in China -- slightly more than before the Communist Revolution in 1949. Persecuted during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, China's Christians were forced to go underground while churches were looted and turned into government warehouses and priests were sent off to factories, farms and prison camps.<br><br>China's current leadership eased restrictions on religion in the mid 1970s and it has been allowed to re- blossom, but on a limited scale.<br><br>The Chingwenmen church, a Methodist house of worship until it was annexed to a neighboring middle school in 1958, was returned to the Protestants last July and inaugurated Christmas Eve with a two-hour service.<br><br>Renovation of the octagonal church, built in 1903, continued until the last minute as workers toiled around the clock the day before to whitewash the walls that still smelled of fresh paint and piece together hundreds of old radiator parts that in the end did not work.<br><br>Down dark alleys, on foot and on bikes, Chinese began converging on the new church a few hours after nightfall. An old man hobbled in with the help of two grandaughters, followed by a slim youth in a black imitation leather jacket and carrying a red crash helmet in one hand and a Bible in the other. Another old man with sallow cheeks and hands as rough as bark groped in a plastic bag, extracting first a Bible, then a pair of ragged orange mittens and finally a tattered song book for his granddaughter to join in a chorus of 'Silent Night,' whose words he knew by heart.<br><br>When the service ended, he carefully packed his belongings back into the bag, pulled down the peek of his blue Mao cap and followed his grandaughter's lead to the door.<br><br>For a moment he hesitated. Then he turned to the foreigner standing next to him and said, 'Merry Christmas,' before hobbling out into the night. "

    "title": "Despite new leader, Iran power struggle is far from over",
    "text": "The appointment of President Ali Khamenei as the successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is a victory for pragmatists seeking to ease Iran's international isolation, but a power struggle in that chaotic country is far from over, according to experts on Iran.<br><br>The analysts interpret the naming of Khamenei, 49, as a step engineered by Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Parliament speaker and a leading contender for power in post-Khomeini Iran. An 83-member Assembly of Experts gave Khamenei the promotion one day after Khomeini's death.<br><br>''It's a good thing and the first victory for Rafsanjani after Khomeini's death,'' said Fahmy Huweidy, an Egyptian writer on Islam who recently visited Iran. ''For those of us outside Iran, it is also positive. But the power struggle will go on at least until presidential elections in August.''<br><br>Khamenei himself told Tehran television that his leadership is temporary, pending a review of the constitution that was ordered by Khomeini shortly before his death.<br><br>The review is to be completed before the presidential elections in which Khamenei, a two-term president, cannot run again. ''The power struggle will intensify and become more open,'' said a Western diplomat based in a Persian Gulf country. ''Under Khomeini, there were always disagreements but there was also a certain cohesiveness. With the death of Khomeini, Iran has lost its anchor and stabilizer.''<br><br>In recent months, though, the ailing Khomeini had not seemed much of a stabilizer.<br><br>For a short while after Iran's grudging acceptance last summer of a cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iraq, the country that had previously branded foreign powers as ''greater or lesser satans'' presented a more conciliatory face to the world and solicited Western participation in its postwar reconstruction.<br><br>But in February came an about-face. The glowering ayatollah called for Moslems to execute British author Salman Rushdie for writing a book deemed to blaspheme Islam. European governments recoiled and downgraded relations, and Iranian officials who had sought to build bridges to the West were purged.<br><br>In March, Khomeini deepened Iran's internal political confusion by firing his designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri. Montazeri had apparently offended Khomeini by criticizing the failings of the 10-year- old Islamic revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed shah of Iran.<br><br>The next month, the Iranian leader took a potential step toward resolving the power struggle. He appointed a committee to revise Iran's constitution in advance of the August presidential elections. The only announced candidate in those elections is Rafsanjani, a wily survivor of the revolution's many twists and turns. With substantial backing from parliament, he is seeking to revise the constitution to strengthen the office of president by abolishing the post of prime minister, currently held by hard-liner Hussein Musavi. But besides Musavi, Rafsanjani, who is considered a pragmatist despite his recent echoing of Tehran's latest anti-Western line, has other hard-line rivals: the interior minister, Ali Akbar Montashemi; Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, chairman of the Council of Experts; and Ahmed Khomeini, the late Iranian leader's son.In recent months, Ahmed Khomeini assumed a high profile and functioned almost as his father's stand-in. But he lacks a formal government position.<br><br>''Ahmed has neither the religious credentials nor the administrative experience to rule, and it's not clear whether claiming dynastic credentials will be enough,'' said Shahram Chubin, an scholar on Iran at the Institute of International Studies in Geneva.<br><br>''The appointment of Khamenei is a bad sign for Ahmed,'' added Huweidy, the Egyptian writer. He called the choice surprising because Khamenei, like Rafsanjani, is only a hojatoislam, a lesser rank of cleric than ayatollah. He said it was still possible that a council of three or five clerics would be named to perform Khomeini's religious functions.<br><br>Analysts said no one man could or would take Khomeini's place since the ayatollah was both Iran's supreme religious and temporal authority.<br><br>Also uncertain is the effect Khomeini's death will have on Iran's frayed relations with other countries.<br><br>While Iranian leaders may be ''too busy among themselves to start new mischief abroad, they are also unlikely to make conciliatory gestures toward the West or the Arabs,'' one Egyptian military expert said.<br><br>Until the domestic power struggle is resolved, the United Nations-sponsored talks on turning last summer's cease-fire into a peace treaty with Iraq are likely to remain stalled.<br><br>And Westerners held hostage for years by Iranian-backed factions in Beirut will probably remain captives. Egyptian and Western experts said they doubted that Iraq, which started the gulf war by invading Iran in 1980, would mount any aggressive military actions to take advantage of the current interregnum in Iran.<br><br>''The Iraqis will not try again,'' said the Egyptian military expert. ''They learned their lesson.'' However, Iranian leftist opposition groups based in Iraq vowed to step up their struggle against the Tehran regime. The death of Khomeini should further diminish Iran's attraction as a model for other would-be Islamic revolutionaries, already demoralized by Iran's bloody post-revolutionary record and its failure to defeat Iraq in the gulf war.<br><br>When he seized power in 1979, Khomeini promised to build the first authentic Islamic government the world had seen since the origins of the religion in the Arabian desert 1,300 years ago.<br><br>But he leaves behind a country ruined by a war that he prolonged - in a vain bid for vengeance against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein - and a leadership still divided over how to translate medieval Islamic precepts into a coherent program for modern government. Attempted reforms in industry, agriculture and labor relations have been stymied by disagreements between conservative clerics who favor private enterprise and militants who support state ownership. Even laws imposing Islamic dress on women and banning alcohol and Western music have had only superficial success.<br><br>Besides 1-million war casualties, the repeated waves of executions of thousands of political dissidents, drug dealers and other alleged criminals without any semblance of due process have horrified many Iranians. Since the revolution, more than 2-million of the country's 50-million people have fled, many of them professionals urgently needed for Iran's development. Iranian attempts to export the revolution have also largely failed, except in even more troubled Lebanon.<br><br>In Beirut, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the Hezbollah or ''Party of God'' that is believed to be holding Western hostages, told his supporters Sunday: ''We may face a difficult period ... but even though he (Khomeini) has left us, he has left a part of himself ... in each one of us. We are all Khomeinis after his death.''"

    "text": "Fifi Abdu's spacious Cairo duplex is lavishly furnished, with an oval bar, several colour television sets and enough opulently padded sectional seating to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly.<br><br>As one of Egypt's most popular belly dancers, Miss Fifi, as she is called, can afford such luxury. But others in her profession are not so well off. Belly dancing has had its ups and downs, but rarely have times been as tough as they are now.<br><br>The resurgence in recent years of Muslim fundamentalism has reduced sharply the number of places in the Middle East where belly dancers can perform.<br><br>\"I came to Egypt because it is the centre of belly dancing - it is where you have to prove yourself,\" says Lisa Loevenguth, from New York. \"But I have been disappointed. Belly dancers here are treated like criminals.\"<br><br>Belly dancers are not being paid as well, either, because of increased competition for jobs in a shrinking market.<br><br>The Gulf countries, with the exception of the United Arab Emirates, have banned belly dancing. Lebanon used to be one of the main centres for belly dancing but only the bravest of the brave would work there now. Syria and Iraq still have belly dancing, but neither has the night life or the culture to qualify as a mecca for the dance. That leaves Egypt and even here the outlook is far from bright.<br><br>Last February, when police conscripts took to the streets to complain about being underpaid, they were joined by Muslim fundamentalists and burnt down several hotels and more than a dozen nightclubs.<br><br>A big drop in tourism, the result of Middle East terrorism, and domestic disturbances like the police riots, has forced the large hotels and nightclubs to cut back on entertainment.<br><br>According to Medhat Hawary, a businessman and belly dance aficionado: \"It's not like it used to be. Before, if a belly dancer with a name was dancing, people would come every night to see her.<br><br>\"But now ... people don't go out any more. It's the economy, mostly. But also people are afraid of the fundamentalists.\"<br><br>A big name dancer like Fifi Abdu earns about $A2,250 a show, and may perform several times a night. But the overheads are high. The dancer must pay her musicians - small-time dancers often have 30-piece bands - and costumes can cost thousands of dollars.<br><br>Some dancers complain that ever-tightening government restrictions also crimp their styles. Belly dancers in Egypt must wear body stockings now when they perform, and many have been forced to tone down their acts. \"It is ridiculous,\" Sahar Hamdi, another famous dancer, says. \"First they interfered with the way we dress, now with the way we dance. They won't let me be sexy any more. A belly dancer must be sexy. It is the nature of the dance. "

Yang of Seton Hall University of South Orange, N.J., in a conversation last June, according to Xinhua.<br><br>Deng was in effect restating earlier proposals but he sought to assure the Nationalist government.

    "text": "CAIRO - Egypt's latest archaeological expedition will be a success even if it comes up with nothing more than thin air.<br><br>Air, the older the better, is in fact a prime target of the project to penetrate a pit at the foot of the Pyramid of Cheops that scientists hope has remained sealed for thousands of years.<br><br>Believed to have been dug 4,600 years ago at the time of the Pharaoh Cheops, the pit was one of two discovered in 1952 by a young Egyptologist named Kamal el-Mallakh, who was clearing rubble from the site of earlier excavations. Two years later, Mallakh received permission for his own excavation. He chiseled a hole through one of the limestone blocks covering one of pits and found the intact pieces of an ancient boat - a graceful funerary bark of Lebanese cedar that may have been intended to carry Cheops' spirit on a mythic journey through the heavens. The find was acclaimed at the time as the most marvelous since the discovery of the tomb of King Tutankhamun by the Englishman Howard Carter, and Mallakh later described his sensations in Carteresque terms.<br><br>''I closed my eyes. And then . . . I smelt incense, a very holy, holy, holy smell. I smelt time . . . I smelt centuries . . . I smelt history.''<br><br>Thrilling as it was, Mallakh's olfactory experience is something the latest expedition doesn't want to repeat.<br><br>While team members would be delighted to discover a second boat, they aim to explore the second pit without allowing one whiff of its atmosphere to escape - or modern pollution to flow in.<br><br>The new project, co-sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, will use high-tech equipment borrowed from the exploration of space and the maintenance of nuclear power stations to penetrate the pit without contaminating it. ''This is the only place we have in Egypt that we know of that was deliberately sealed by the ancient Egyptians and perhaps has stayed sealed,'' said Dr. Omar el-Arini, an Egyptian scientist and adviser to the project who helped draft the original proposal for non-destructive exploration.<br><br>''It's a remote chance that the air is still that old,'' cautioned Elie Rogers, project coordinator for the National Geographic Society. ''Think of all the earthquakes, floods and the microfissures that may have occurred in the rock. But it's a chance that can't be passed up.''<br><br>For more than two years, the team has been assembling and developing techniques. They have drilled through limestone similar to the five-foot-thick slabs that cover the cavity. The site has been surveyed three times with ground penetrating radar to try to gauge the contours of the interior and choose the emptiest place to drill. The National Geographic Society even built a fake pharaonic tomb to test a remote-controlled camera.<br><br>The preparations have finally been completed. Later this week, the team is expected to start drilling a hole three and a half inches in diameter through one of the 40, 14-ton limestone blocks that cover the pit.<br><br>A special drill, similar to one used on Apollo missions to the moon, has been selected. It operates without any lubricant, to prevent the introduction of harmful moisture, and can work at a relatively slow speed to avoid causing tiny cracks in the surrounding stone, Arini said. To prevent any exchange of gases between the chamber and the outside atmosphere, a special air lock hasbeen designed by one of the team members, Robert Moore, an amateur Egyptologist and product development manager for the American power tool manufacturer, Black and Decker Inc.<br><br>Once the hole is made, air samples will be collected.<br><br>Then a tiny, remote-controlled camera on a pneumatic arm, like those used to look for cracks in nuclear power plants, will be lowered through the narrow opening to discover what, if anything, is inside.<br><br>Special sensors will also be inserted into the cavity to measure temperature, humidity and the concentration of various gases.<br><br>If the environment in the pit is found to be unsullied, Arini said, preservationists may gain a better understanding of how to protect artifacts unearthed after thousands of years from rapid decay.<br><br>''We hope we can simulate the same atmosphere in a museum environment for intensive care measures for something that is threatened, for example mummies,'' he said.<br><br>If a second pharaonic boat is found, curators might be able to preserve it better than the first boat, which was damaged during the decade it took to assemble it and was kept for years in conditions of excessive heat and humidity. Only five years ago was air conditioning installed in the glass- walled museum where the 140-foot- long boat, with its distinctive prow modeled after a bundle of papyrus reeds, now resides close to the place of its ancient burial. Beyond the secrets of preservation, scientists are interested in analyzing ancient air to learn more about present atmospheric conditions - in particular how mankind has polluted the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels and releasing ozone-destroying fluorocarbons.<br><br>Older air has been discovered in bubbles in ice caps, but not in sufficient quantity to conduct extensive tests, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<br><br>Team members include an ''air specialist,'' Dr. Pieter Tans of the University of Colorado, who does research for NOAA. Also associated with the project is Dr. Farouk el-Baz, an Egyptian-born scientist who worked on the Apollo missions for NASA and now directs the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University. Even if the air turns out to be disappointingly fresh and the pit otherwise empty, Egyptian officials say the project will have scientific merit. It will help refine the high-tech, non-destructive methods that have replaced the Raiders of the Lost Ark approach to archaeology."

    "text": "Godzilla has been awakened from a nine-year nap and, boy, is he grumpy. Salvaged from the ocean depths after poor box-office receipts forced him into retirement, Japan's rowdiest reptile is back in a tail-swishing new film that premiered Dec. 15.<br><br>This time, Godzilla is bigger and meaner than ever as he lurches through downtown Tokyo, noshing on nuclear reactors and doing to skyscrapers what macho men do to empty beer cans.<br><br>For Godzilla, this is the second character change since he first stomped across the silver screen in 1954. A villain back then, Godzilla got nicer in subsequent films until at last he was cast as a good monster, fighting alongside mankind for truth, justice and the Japanese way.<br><br>Alas, as Godzilla's demeanor improved, his box office appeal declined.<br><br>'The fans did not like Godzilla when he was good,' said Masaru Yabe, a spokesman for Godzilla's producers, Toho Productions. 'They wanted to see a bad Godzilla. They wanted to see him eat Tokyo again.'<br><br>And so in his new flick, entitled simply 'Godzilla,' it's no more Mr. Nice Lizard.<br><br>'In this film, we have returned to the original Godzilla. He is strong and powerful. He is a real monster,' said Koji Hashimoto, 'Godzilla's' director.<br><br>As the film opens, Godzilla has been awakened by a volcanic eruption. He's hungry after nine years -- and of course real monsters don't eat quiche.<br><br>Godzilla prefers plutonium, which he obtains by wading ashore and cracking open a nuclear reactor. So sated, he goes on to dispose of a Russian submarine, a squadron of U.S. jets, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and of course, central Tokyo. Along the way, he provokes a superpower confrontation and brings the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.<br><br>But wait. There is more to this monster than meets the eye. Behind all the smoke and fire, beneath the rubble of downtown Tokyo, there is a message. For Godzilla has been resurrected not merely to terrorize the world but to sermonize to it about the dangers of nuclear energy.<br><br>The United States and the Soviet Union want to nuke Godzilla, not realizing that this monster goes for MX missiles the way kids go for Hostess Twinkies. But the wise and moral Japanese prime minister refuses, arguing there must be a better way of solving the world's problems.<br><br>'In the first Godzilla movie in 1954, the monster was awakened by a nuclear explosion and the message was against nuclear testing,' said Hashimoto. 'This time the theme is broader -- the risk of nuclear energy in all its forms. This is the message I want to spread to the world through this film.'<br><br>The world, however, may not get to see the $6 million film unless someone is willing to pay the $5 million that Toho is asking for foreign distribution rights.<br><br>'We have had discussions with several companies including Paramount and Universal but they have not been successful. Their offers were too cheap,' said Kei Nakagawa, Toho's promotion director.<br><br>Nagagawa said the best offer so far has been $2 million, but that he believes someone will meet Toho's price once Godzilla proves his popularity in Japan again. 'We are sure the film will be a success. Then the foreign companies will change their minds,' he said. To ensure that it is a success, Toho has pumped $1.5 million into a massive promotional campaign that hasplastered Godzilla's monstrous face on everything from T-shirts to chewing gum labels. There are Godzilla dolls, Godzilla records and even a number fans can call to hear Godzilla screech over the phone. 'We have learned how to promote films by watching the way the Americans promote films like Ghostbusters,' said Nakagawa, who shows up for interviews wearing a varsity jacket with Godzilla's name emblazoned on the back.<br><br>And there's more. Spied on the wall of a Tokyo men's room recently was the legend:<br><br>'Godzilla lives.' "

    "text": "ALGIERS, Algeria - To cheers and applause early this morning, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared independence for a Palestinian state and called on Palestinians around the world to make the state a reality.<br><br>Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), made the declaration at 1:40 a.m. (7:40 p.m. EST Monday) to climax a watershed meeting of the Palestinians' informal parliament. The meeting also approved a key United Nations Security Council resolution that recognizes Israel's right to exist. The declaration did not set out the new state's boundaries, which the Palestinians say should be determined in future negotiations. It had been expected that the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would be included in the homeland.<br><br>The news does not mean that the Palestinians automatically have a state.<br><br>Israel rejected results of the meeting in advance and does not intend to hand over the occupied territories simply because of a document.<br><br>In Washington on Monday, President Reagan said PLO recognition of Israel ''would be some progress,'' but added: ''There are other problems that remain to be solved.''<br><br>The declaration of independence came shortly after the Palestine National Council (PNC), a quasi-legislature of the PLO, voted overwhelmingly to accept U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, long the cornerstone of international efforts to secure peace in the Middle East. The resolution, formulated in 1967 after the Six-Day War, established the principle that all states in the region - including Israel - are entitled to live in peace ''within secure and recognized boundaries.'' It also calls for the convening of an international conference to negotiate a settlement of longstanding territorial disputes between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The vote in favor of the resolution, forced by PLO hard-liners who opposed its acceptance and led by Marxist guerrilla chiefs George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, was 253-46 with 10 abstentions. Arafat began his address to the conference in a subdued voice, reading a declaration that reviewed the long and tragic history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.<br><br>''Despite the historical injustice inflicted on the Palestinian-Arabic people,'' Arafat said the Palestinian parliament is now willing to base its declaration of independence on 41-year-old U.N. Resolution 181, which partitioned Palestine into two states - one Arab, one Jewish.<br><br>Arafat, wearing his customary combat fatigues, declared the independent state to the jubilant council members saying: ''In the name of God, in the name of the Palestinian people, and in the name of the Arab people, the Palestine National Council announces the existence of the Palestinian state. Palestine is for the Palestinians everywhere.''<br><br>Later he described the council's actions as proclaiming the establishment of ''a Palestinian state on Palestinian land with holy Jerusalem as its capital.''<br><br>The conference center on the outskirts of Algiers erupted in applause, and Arafat received a brief standing ovation. A few women ululated, the shrill cry emitted by Arab women in celebration and several balloons in the colors of the Palestinian flag - red, green, black and white - were tossed in the air. An Algerian band played the Palestinian national anthem, a Palestinian flag was raised, and Algeriaannounced its recognition of the new state.<br><br>Members of the audience interrupted Arafat's speech several times to chant slogans addressed to Israel. ''Listen, listen, Shamir, we want the right of self-determination,'' they yelled, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.<br><br>''Tell Shamir, tell Rabin that we will not give up until we have liberated our land,'' went another cry, referring to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin who has been in charge of suppressing the nearly 1-year-old uprising by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.<br><br>Nov. 15 had been declared in advance as Palestinian independence day, and the early morning statement was timed so Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories would wake up to the news.<br><br>But despite the cries and applause and chanting of slogans, the mood in the hall at the end of the three-day conference was relatively subdued.<br><br>PNC delegates said they realized they still have a long road ahead to achieve their goal of an independent homeland, but said they hoped the declaration would boost the morale of the Palestinians in the Israeli- occupied territories and around the world.<br><br>''The intifada (uprising) will have a new impetus,'' said Dr. Hanna Nasser, the president of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. ''Now the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories are in agreement on a well- defined aim.''<br><br>Nasser, who was deported by by Israel for his membership in the PLO a decade ago, added, ''I'm pleased we are in the process of getting our independent state. We declared it, we haven't gotten it yet, but at least it's a beginning.''<br><br>- Information from the Associated Press and the Washington Post was used in this report."

    "title": "Khadafy's Libya -- where Mao meets Daffy Duck",
    "text": "TRIPOLI, Libya - It was Saturday night at Sinbad's, Tripoli's premier state-owned restaurant, and the menu boasted a rare treat - meat.<br><br>At a corner table, a group of Soviets wearing dour expressions and imitation leather jackets were washing down the last of their meal with Jamahiriya Cola, the local version of Coke. Smiling down on them from the wall was a larger-than-life portrait of a man whose jowls were creased with sinuous lines that called to mind the dunes of the desert where he was born.<br><br>The smile, at once hard and serene, was lighted by a little green lamp that was intended to move in graceful circles around the portrait. Instead, it made palsied jerks, flickering across the face of Col. Moammar Khadafy, leader, teacher and self-proclaimed spiritual guide of Libya's so-called Green Revolution.<br><br>The smile is everywhere in Tripoli - in bakeries, where sweaty men in dirty aprons make bread while long queues of people wait outside; in the supermarkets, where there are long rows of empty shelves; at the city's few shabby movie houses.<br><br>At Sinbad's, a waiter serves the daily special - watery soup, cold French fries and thin strips of gray, overcooked beef - to a group of foreigners. He sees their looks of disappointment and says softly: \"Look, I know it's terrible, but you must understand the situation. It's all we've got. I'm sorry.\" Sixteen years after Khadafy overthrew King Idris, nine years after he undertook his Green Revolution and two years after the bottom began falling out of oil prices, Libya under the mercurial colonel has fallen on exceedingly hard times.<br><br>Essential commodities are nonexistent or at best scarce. Long lines form for everything from meat and bread to soap and diapers. Construction cranes stand idle against the stubby skyline; once signposts of progress, they serve as grave markers for dozens of construction projects that have been postponed or cancelled. Green Book<br><br>Although Libya is still better off than many of its neighbors - it is still the richest country in Africa - the sudden decline in the standard of living has fanned widespread discontent with Khadafy's regime, according to more than a score of diplomats, foreign businessmen and Libyans interviewed in Tripoli.<br><br>Western businessmen with access to high-level Libyan officials say these officials complain their efforts to cope with declining oil revenues have been hamstrung by Khadafy's determination to run Libya according to his eclectic Green Book philosophy, described by one observer as \"part Maoism, part Nasserism and part the world according to Daffy Duck.\"<br><br>One businessman who meets regularly with senior Libyan officials said, \"Everyone I talk to nowadays admits that the system doesn't work, and that they are fed up.\"<br><br>Diplomats say the unrest has become evident - in the streets, on university campuses and, more significant, in the ranks of the armed forces, 76,000 strong.<br><br>In the past six months there have been at least two food riots, several campus demonstrations and a reported coup attempt that ended in the death of Col. Hassan Ishkal, a Khadafy cousin. Some reports say Ishkal may have been shot by Khadafy himself. The drastic decline in oil earnings - to $11.2 billion last year and perhaps no more than $7 billion this year from $31 billion in 1980 - has forced the government to slash imports, suspend work on all but a few high- priority projects and delay payments to nervous Western and East Bloc creditors who collectively are owed an estimated $11.2 billion.But, so far, the economic crisis does not seem to have affected Khadafy's revolutionary ways. Military purchases from the East Bloc reportedly still run about $1.4 billion a year, and the colonel seems as determined as ever to spread his unique version of socialism beyond Libya's shores through what one diplomat calls his \"nuisance budget\" - the money he lavishes on revolutionary movements around the world.<br><br>Because of the secretive nature of such expenditures, and the fact that no budget has been announced for 1986, it is difficult to find out to what extent Khadafy's military adventures and his support for guerrilla organizations are sapping Libya's income.<br><br>But apart from the \"Great Man-Made River Project,\" an ambitious scheme to pump water from wells beneath the Sahara Desert to the faraway Libyan coast, it is clear that very little is being spent on anything else.<br><br>Imports were reduced last year to $2.5 billion from a budgeted $7 billion, and the level is believed to be even lower now. Until a hurried delivery of beef from Ireland a few weeks ago, meat had been unavailable for months. At the Jamahiriya supermarket, one of Tripoli's showcase stores, the cooler shelves are stocked with powdered milk, clarified butter, tomato paste, insecticide and tea - and nothing else.<br><br>So far, the government's response to economic problems has only seemed to aggravate them. Khadafy, for example, has sought to use the revenue crisis to further his ideas of revolutionary self-sufficiency. He has called on Libyans to stop relying on imports and to work harder in order to attain economic independence.<br><br>With only 3.5 million people, Libya is heavily dependent on foreign labor. Foreigners run most of the service industries, they work in the fields, and they are present in large numbers even in the armed forces, which rely heavily on pilots from Pakistan and technicians from other Arab and African countries, according to Western diplomats.<br><br>Tension in military<br><br>Although the food shortages and other economic hardships are the biggest source of discontent, other measures introduced or accelerated by Khadafy over the past year to further his Maoist experiment in social upheaval have also been unpopular, diplomats and other Tripoli residents say.<br><br>\"There were a lot of complaints last year when Khadafy decided that everybody up to the age of 55 or 60 had to serve one day per week and one month per year in the People's Army,\" a diplomat said, referring to the organization that according to Khadafy's Green Book will someday replace the standing army. Even though training \"seems to consist mostly of light exercises and a lot of shouting,\" most Libyans \"were shocked that they made aged people go to it,\" the diplomat said.<br><br>Most observers agree that if Khadafy faces any real threat it can only be from within the army, which is the only organized institution left in the country.<br><br>There is said to be tension among the military men. Diplomats say they are prohibited from having direct contact with the military, but rumors persist that some in the army are upset with the erosion of its prestige since Khadafy began setting up the rival People's Army two years ago.<br><br>Other diplomats say they doubt the army is capable of doing anything because Khadafy, who is aware of the unrest, has set up so many systems of control and surveillance that would-be plotters are discovered before they have a chance to act.<br><br>One point that virtually every diplomat, businessman and Libyan interviewed in Tripoli agrees on is that Khadafy's efforts to silence critics has had help from an unlikely quarter, the United States.<br><br>The U.S. attempt to force a confrontation with Khadafy in the Gulf of Sidra two weeks ago was evidently planned by the administration of President Ronald Reagan in the hope of stimulating dissatisfaction in the army and encouraging more coup attempts. But in the opinion of all the analysts interviewed here, the limited conflict that took place is likely to have the opposite effect\"This whole crisis has helped Khadafy immensely at a time when he really needed it,\" one diplomat said. \"Libyans may dislike Khadafy, but they are Arabs and they are very proud, and this was perceived as an attack not against Khadafy but against Libya, because Libyan territory was attacked and Libyan lives were lost.\" "

    "title": "EGYPTIANS REALLY LIVE FOR FEASTS THAT END FASTS OF RAMADAN",
    "text": "CAIRO, Egypt _ The ragged gray clouds swiftly scraping their way across the sky cast a shadow over the outdoor table where the men were seated, talking in low, almost hushed tones. There were 12 of them there, and there was something vaguely conspiratorial about their demeanor, about their quick, furtive glances, their obvious impatience<br><br>Every now and then they looked at their wristwatches, as if urging the hands forward to the appointed time. Then came the signal for which they had been waiting. For a moment they sat rigid and silent, listening to the cries from the mosques across the river Nile _ ``Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar (God is great).'' Then, rising abruptly, they turned and strode swiftly across the courtyard, toward a man in a white suit who waited for them at the far end. They carried knives, forks and spoons, and they looked hungry. The maitre d' handed them plates, and they quickly began heaping them with grilled lamb, chicken, stuffed grape leaves, salad and sweets from the long buffet table. Iftar, the nightly ``breakfast'' that follows a day of sunup-to-sundown fasting during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, had begun.<br><br>All across the Moslem world, from the jungles of Malaysia to the deserts of Saudi Arabia, similar scenes are being repeated nightly.<br><br>Ramadan, which began in Egypt April 29 this year, commemorates the time nearly 14 centuries ago when, according to Moslem belief, God revealed the first verses of the Koran to the Prophet Mohammed.<br><br>Reckoned by the lunar calendar, the month begins when the first sliver of the new moon appears, and it continues until the crescent reappears about 30 days later. During this period, Moslems are expected to abstain from food, drink, cigarettes and sex during daylight hours. Only sick people, pregnant women, travelers and soldiers at war are exempt from these restrictions.<br><br>In theory, Ramadan is a period of piety and praying, of sacrifice and charity toward the poor. In some countries, however, what is preached is not always what is strictly practiced.<br><br>In ultraconservative countries like Saudi Arabia, Koranic injunctions are followed to the letter _ at least in public. But in more open countries like Egypt, self-denial during the day is usually compensated for by overindulgence after dark. Indeed, Ramadan during the evening is a bit like Thanksgiving or Christmas in the West _ a time for feasting and family get-togethers.<br><br>Punctuality is not known to be an Egyptian trait, but the iftar feast beginning at sundown is one occasion when it is inexcusable to be late. In Cairo, a single volley from a cannon atop Saladin's ancient citadel signals the start of the feast and, as the word is spread from district to district via neighborhood mosques, 15 million Egyptians, utensils in hand, sit down to an evening meal that usually lasts for hours.<br><br>During Ramadan, virtually the entire country goes on an overnight shift. People leave work early, take long naps, get up for iftar and then stay awake until 3 or 4 in the morning, when they sit down to sohour, an early morning meal before sunrise. Then they nap for a few more hours before arriving at their offices bleary-eyed and late.<br><br>The strains of daytime fasting, of not eating, not drinking heavily sweetened tea and not smoking cigarettes _ pleasures elevated to the status of national pastimes in Egypt _ take their toll on the characteristic geniality of Egyptians. Although statistics are hard to come by, most Egyptians would readily agree that there are more quarrelsduring Ramadan, more fistfights and more traffic accidents than at other times of the year.<br><br>Indeed, a Cairo newspaper once complained that Ramadan had become ``synonymous with a short temper, apathy, insolence, day-long yawning, doing less work and, if possible, none.''<br><br>Despite the resurgence in recent years of Islamic fundamentalism, that state of affairs has not changed much.<br><br>The pious still preach against the commercialization of Ramadan, noting that the Prophet Mohammed broke his fast in the evenings with only dates and water. But the majority of Egyptians _ and this has always been their genius _ still find ways of softening their hardship with good humor, with an innate ability to enjoy themselves and a keen eye for any excuse to do it.<br><br>``Look, I am as religious as most men,'' said one of the diners plunging into his iftar feast at the outdoor restaurant on the Nile. ``But who says that if we have to suffer, we can't at least enjoy it?'

    "text": "Among Washington insiders, the acronym AIPAC has long aroused strong emotions ranging from fear and loathing to admiration and respect.<br><br>But these days, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee has lost some of its luster as it strives to adjust to new political realities in both Israel and the United States.<br><br>Known for its sophistication in pursuing its mandate to bolster U.S. support for Israel, the 38-year-old organization has bee publicly embarrassed twice in the past month.<br><br>First, its president, David Steiner, was tape-recorded boasting to a contributor that the organization had \"\"a dozen people'' in President-elect Bill Clinton's entourage and could influence the selection of the next secretary of state. Steiner also bragged that he had obtained \"\"almost a billion dollars in other goodies'' for Israel in secret talks with former Secretary of State James Baker.<br><br>After the tape was leaked to the Washington Times and published, Steiner recanted his remarks and resigned.<br><br>A week later, AIPAC was obliged to deny several published reports that some of its leaders had been lobbying against the appointment of Warren Christopher, director of the Clinton transition board, as secretary of state. Christopher served as deputy secretary in the Carter administration, which some Jewish groups think extracted excessive concessions from Israel to achieve a peace accord with Egypt.<br><br>The incidents were especially disconcerting to a group that had greeted the defeat of President Bush with evident relief.<br><br>The outgoing administration angered many Israel supporters by refusing to approve $10-billion in loan guarantees to resettle immigrants in Israel until the Jewish state agreed to stop building new settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The dispute was resolved only after the Labor Party defeated the Likud bloc in June elections and agreed to the administration's conditions.<br><br>AIPAC's potent reputation was forged in the early 1980s under the Reagan administration, which shared with Israel's Likud leadership a conservative worldview.<br><br>The lobby succeeded in defeating or heading off a number of arms sales to Arab states and claimed credit for the election defeats of such influential legislators as Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill., who was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and had voted for such sales.<br><br>But with the waning of the Cold War, Israel's strategic value as a buffer against Soviet expansionism diminished.<br><br>Critics, including many within the Jewish community, charged that AIPAC was slow to adjust. More seriously, the critics said, the lobby's leaders became too identified with the Likud government and came to regard opposition to Israeli policies as tantamount to anti-Semitism. Recent articles in the Village Voice quoted a former AIPAC employee as asserting that the lobby compiled an \"\"enemies list'' that included liberal Jews such as actor Richard Dreyfuss, a prominent supporter of the dovish group Peace Now.<br><br>AIPAC officials vehemently denied that they do more than maintain ordinary newspaper files about people who speak out on the Middle East.<br><br>\"\"The image of what we do is very different from the reality,'' said one veteran staffer.Michael Lerner, editor of the dovish U.S. publication Tikkun, disagreed.<br><br>He asserted that AIPAC officials had disparaged him to reporters in an effort to dissuade them from quoting him.<br><br>\"\"They hold a worldview that their perception of the needs of Israel justifies an immoral way of acting,'' he said. Such behavior, he added, actually hurts Jews and Israel because \"\"it plays to the worst anti-Semitic fantasies of what the Jewish people are.'' Visiting the United States in August, the new Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, also lambasted AIPAC tactics. \"\"You waged battles which were lost in advance and so you merely caused Israel damage by generating unnecessary antagonism,'' Rabin said, according to the Jerusalem Post. AIPAC officials assert that relations with the new Israeli government have been repaired and note that Rabin has agreed to come to the United States to address the lobby's annual policy conference.<br><br>Despite its recent travails, the organization retains many strengths. With a nationwide membership of 55,000 representing a cross section of American Jews, an annual budget of $15-million and a Washington staff of 140, it dwarfs other Jewish political groups and foreign policy organizations.<br><br>\"\"You have to admire AIPAC for its ability to hire the best people,'' said Gail Pressburg, co-director of the Washington office of Americans for Peace Now, a group with one-fifth AIPAC's membership. \"\"They have a very sophisticated lobbying operation and a strong grass-roots network.'' But congressional staffers and members of other liberal Jewish organizations said they think the recent incidents had caused significant damage.<br><br>\"\"The intimidation factor is definitely down on (Capitol) Hill, in the Jewish community and elsewhere,'' said a staffer at a rival Jewish group.<br><br>At a time when the nation is more focused on domestic affairs and when lobbies of all sorts are suspect, AIPAC may have its work cut out for itself simply to maintain the high level of U.S. support - more than $3- billion a year - Israel has received.<br><br>Although Clinton won nearly 80 percent of the Jewish vote, some of Israel's strongest supporters in Congress, such as Reps. Larry Smith, D-Fla., Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and Mel Levine, D-Calif., either did not run for re- election or lost on Nov. 3.<br><br>\"\"It's an absolutely fresh start and no one knows what to expect,'' said one senior Capitol Hill staffer."

    "text": "BABYLON, Iraq - A 30-foot billboard of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and a blue-tiled replica of the 2,500- year-old Ishtar Gate usher visitors to Babylon, the ancient capital that Iraq is restoring as a symbol of its power, old and new.<br><br>Despite the pressures of war and in some ways because of them, Hussein's government is sparing no expense to try to resurrect some of the glories that were Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled from 605 to 562 B.C.<br><br>This was the city where Hammurabi the Lawgiver also reigned, Alexander the Great died, the Tower of Babel rose and Assyrians, Medes, Chaldeans, Greeks and Persians battled for supremacy.<br><br>Little is left of its ancient wonders. The famous tower, where God is said to have made the people of the world speak in different languages, was really a stepped pyramid known as a ziggurat and is now a large square hole in the ground. The location of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, remains suspended in the imagination. Over the centuries, peasants have pilfered the city's sturdy mud bricks. What they didn't take, turn-of-the-century Europea n archaeologists did - to museums in Paris and Berlin.<br><br>What is left is a sprawling landscape of gentle brown hills studded with fragments of mud-brick walls. Starting with this raw material, the Iraqis are trying to re-create the Babylonian landscape of Nebuchadnezzar's time when Babylon was the most magnificent city in the Near East.<br><br>The project began eight years ago but has recently picked up steam so that a half-dozen sites - a theater, several palaces, gates and temples - will be ready to receive thousands of visitors to an international cultural festival planned in September.<br><br>There has been some criticism of the swift restoration, which appears to consist chiefly of laying fireproof bricks on top of the ancient foundations. Better, some restorers think, to have left the uneven old walls, some with the heads of dragons, the bodies of fish, the tails of snakes and the legs of lions and eagles.<br><br>The new brickwork clashes with the old, like a modern extension on a Victorian town house. At the entrance to the city, next to the required picture of President Hussein, the Iraqis have erected a half-sized model of the Ishtar Gate, which gives the site a Walt Disney flavor. (The beautifully glazed tiles of the original now reside in a museum in East Berlin.)<br><br>The additions don't seem to have bothered Iraqi tourists, who come to enjoy the pure air and tranquil atmosphere and have littered the grounds with sardine and soda cans for future archaeologists to uncover. They also have left writing on the walls, though not quite on the order of the injunction to the Biblical King Belshazzar that he had been ''weighed in the balance and found wanting,'' and that his kingdom's days were numbered. The new inscriptions, which cover the walls of the restored temple to the Goddess Emach, say ''Felix was here'' and Pedro and Ahmed and Aladdin.<br><br>For the Hussein government, Babylon is a canvas on which to inscribe a more political statement. Bogged down in a seemingly endless war with Iran, the Iraqis are treating the city as a symbol of their superiority over the Persians who conquered Babylon in 539 B.C. and whose descendants have been fighting Iraq for nearly 6 1/2 years.<br><br>Official guides at the site, 50 miles south of Baghdad, point out the lion of Babylon, the stone figure of the animal pinning the prone body of a man, as signifying that ''no enemy can enter the city of Babylon.''<br><br>The city's ancient defeat is blamed on the Jews, who were brought to Babylon as slaves after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem in 586 B.C., and then helped the Persians to gain liberation. The implication is that Israel, which has been selling arms to Iran, is trying to make history repeat itself, but this time it will fail.Iraqi officials also fault ancient Jewish prudery for inspiring New Testament writers to give Babylon its biblical reputation as ''the mother of harlots and of Earth's abominations'' that, according to the book of Revelation, will be destroyed in one hour on Judgment Day.<br><br>Munir Bashir, a master of the ud, or Arabic lute, who is organizing the September cultural festival, said he would rather focus on Babylon's more uplifting side.<br><br>''Of course, in every time, there is corruption. There is good and bad,'' Bashir said in an interview. ''We will show the people the good things of the period when Babylon was the capital of world civilization and a giver of law and language and science and music and poetry.'' Bashir would like the festival to reflect that past glory. He has asked nations around the world to send their best performers - the Opera Ballet from France, the Kirov Ballet from the Soviet Union and La Scala from Italy, but is awaiting their response.<br><br>From the United States, Bashir has requested another kind of culture - the pop star Madonna. This is a concession to his 17-year-old son who, Bashir explains, ''likes Madonna too much.''<br><br>Bashir has also invited international film stars, whom he will ask to recite translations of the code of Hammurabi, the great king who lived nearly 4,000 years ago and gave the world its first complete, if harsh, legal code. On a lighter note, Bashir said the festival would feature modern conceptions of Babylonian music, costumes, food and even money. The musician-impresario scoffed at suggestions that foreign performers and tourists might be leery of coming to a country in wartime. Babylon has never been hit by an Iranian missile, he said, and even Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini would not stoop that low.<br><br>''If Khomeini tried to bomb Babylon that means he becomes the lowest bit of dirt because he wants to destroy culture,'' Bashir said."

    "text": "CAIRO - Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres agreed with Egypt Friday to work toward an international peace conference in 1987 as the prelude for direct talks between Israel and its Arab adversaries.<br><br>A joint communique read at the end of Peres' three-day visit by his Egyptian counterpart, Esmat Abdel Meguid, said the two delegations were ''convinced there is a need to take necessary measures to expedite the peace process and produce agreement through the convening in 1987 of an international conference leading to direct negotiations between all the parties concerned.''<br><br>By explicitly calling for a conference this year, the statement went a little further than the communique ending Peres' last visit to Egypt six months ago. Then he and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak pledged to make 1987 a ''year of negotiations for peace.''<br><br>However, the new statement was no clearer than the last about how to bring about a peace conference. It made no reference to the ''new ideas'' that Peres said Thursday had been raised that day in a two-hour meeting with Mubarak.<br><br>The Israeli foreign minister held an unscheduled second meeting with Mubarak Friday, joining him for breakfast before flying back to Tel Aviv.<br><br>Egypt is eager to end its isolation as the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel. It has endorsed Jordan's call for an international conference as a framework for new negotiations. But formidable obstacles to such a conference remain. Beyond the touchy questions of Arab and Soviet participation, a major hurdle exists in Israel itself. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the right-wing Likud Bloc leader who traded jobs with Peres in October, adamantly opposes an international conference, asserting that the Soviet Union and radical Arabs would use it to demand extreme territorial concessions from Israel. Peres and the Reagan administration, however, have a different concept, viewing an international conference merely as a way to facilitate direct talks involving Israel, Jordan and selected Palestinians. Egypt seemed to endorse this interpretation in Friday's communique, and Meguid repeated later that the talks with Peres had ''put in a very clear perspective the ultimate aim of an international conference (is) to have direct negotiations between the parties concerned.''<br><br>An equally thorny question involves representation for the Palestinians of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Peres hinted at progress over this issue earlier this week, but differed gently with Meguid in their remarks following the reading of the communique.<br><br>Asked whether the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) could participate, Peres said it ''has excluded itself'' from a seat at a peace conference because of its refusal to recognize Israel and renounce terrorism. He noted that Jordan, the Israeli neighbor that has shown the greatest willingness to follow Egypt and negotiate peace with Israel - provided that it has the cover of an international conference - had ''tried to reach an agreement with the the PLO and failed.'' But Meguid said ''we cannot start excluding or separating the parties.'' He said the question of who should represent the Palestinians was ''first and foremost the concern of the Palestinians themselves, and then the other parties have to agree about that.''<br><br>Peres, in a briefing to reporters Thursday, hinted that prominent non-PLO Palestinians would be acceptable to Egypt as well as to Israel.<br><br>While declining public comment on Israeli internal politics, Egyptian officials would clearly like to help Peres become prime minister again. By coming to Egypt and reaffirming support for an international peaceconference, Peres seemed to be laying the groundwork for a future Israeli Cabinet crisis. Shamir, in the United States earlier this week, said Peres had ''no mandate'' to expand the peace process.<br><br>''The significance of the Peres visit is that both he and Egypt want to keep the peace process moving and moving faster,'' said a Western diplomat in Cairo. ''Ultimately, if there is progress, it could lead to a bust-up in the Israeli coalition, but while it's always possible for people there to lose their cool, I don't think it's going to happen in the next few weeks.''<br><br>The diplomat added that he expected the Reagan administration to become ''reinvolved'' in the peace process and predicted that Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy would return to the Middle East toward the end of next month."

    "text": "China said Thursday workers in a radio factory have discovered how to age wine in minutes instead of years in a process that could revolutionize the vintner's art.<br><br>If perfected, the process could be an answer for connoisseurs too impatient to lay down their bottles of wine for the 10 or more years it often takes for wines to mature.<br><br>The technique, developed at a radio factory in a remote northern province bordering the Soviet Union, reportedly achieves in 12 minutes what it normally takes eight years of bottle aging to accomplish. The China Daily, Peking's English-language newspaper, said Thursday the process has been tested at two dozen wineries across China with 'good results.'<br><br>Although the results varied, the newspaper said it was nevertheless a breakthrough in the age-old vintner's art.<br><br>In Jilin province, just south of Heilongjiang province radio factory where the process was invested, the Baicheng Winery said it used the device to achieve in 10 minutes the aging affects of a year in storage, the report said. 'Newly made wines are harsh and astringent to the taste,' the China Daily noted, because of the presence of substances called tannins.<br><br>In traditional wine making, it takes years for tannins break down and interact with acids, fruits and other components, producing a more mellow and complex flavor of a mature wine.<br><br>Until now, it was thought the only way to get a quality, mature wine was to wait.<br><br>'But wine storage creates problems,' the Peking newspaper observed. 'First, there is a delay in marketing and thus in capital turnover. Second, there is the necessity for large warehouses and airtight containers.'<br><br>The process was developed at the Qiqihair Fifth Radio Factory utilizing radio, sound and light waves to speed the aging process, the report said.<br><br>The China Daily said one of the sound and light devices costs between $10,000 and $15,000 and is suitable for a medium-size winery.<br><br>The newspaper did not say what kind of wine was prematurely aged with the device, but China's grape wine is mostly heavy and sweet. The quality of its dry wines, compared to a French bordeaux or a California cabernet sauvignon, is poor. "

    "text": "President Chun Doo Hwan's historic visit to Japan, the first by a South Korean leader, may remove some of the antagonism and resentment that have long stained Japanese-Korean relations.<br><br>But it is not expected to do much for Japan's disadvantaged Korean minority, whose predicament is a legacy of the two countries' bitter past.<br><br>Descendents of forced laborers brought over before and during World War II, the 675,000 Koreans in Japan account for more than 80 percent of the resident alien population. Although most were born here and speak Japanese fluently, they are burdened by negative stereotypes and victimized by what they regard as endemic Japanese racism.<br><br>'Japanese believe that Koreans are violent, poor and dirty,' said Bae Jung Do, a Korean who heads the church- affiliated Research Action Institute for Koreans in Japan.<br><br>South Korea has served notice that Chun will raise the issue of better treatment for Japanese-Koreans in his talks with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone Sept. 6-8.<br><br>Koreans have made economic and social strides in recent years, but they still find many doors closed to them. They enjoy the same rights as Japanese to free education, but even those with prestigious university degrees find that the ladder of success leads nowhere. 'For Koreans, it stops half way up,' said a Western diplomat.<br><br>'Koreans run the businesses that Japanese despise,' adds Akiko Yamaguchi Lee, a Japanese married to a Korean. 'Even our university graduates have to work in bars or as manual laborers because the big Japanese companies won't hire them.' The Korean Residents' Union estimates that Korean men earn on average $425 per month less than their Japanese counterparts.<br><br>'They have prospered in recent years like everyone else, but Koreans are still on the bottom of the social scale,' said a Western diplomat.<br><br>Prejudice stems from the racial and ethnic homogeneity of the Japanese that, as a l984 U.S. State Department report on human rights notes, 'makes them less willing or able to integrate alien residents into their society.'<br><br>The closed nature of Japanese society is something foreign residents frequently complain about. With the Koreans, the problem also has historical roots that have created an enmity often compared to that between the English and the Irish. This enmity traces back to the first Japanese invasions of Korea in the 16th century, although the bitterest memories date from Japan's colonial rule between 1904 and the end of World War II.<br><br>So bitter are those memories that no South Korean leader has been able to bring himself to visit Japan until now. And even now, the visit, which both governments see as an historic turning point in relations, has touched off protests in South Korea by those who still cannot forgive or forget.<br><br>After the war, most of the 2.4 million Koreans in Japan were repatriated. Those who remained, preferring Japanese democracy even with its prejudice to the political turmoil in their newly divided homeland, lost their Japanese citizenship in 1952 when the San Francisco Peace Treaty formally stripped Japan of its colonies.<br><br>They are now free to apply for new citizenship, but only about 100,000 -- less than one-sixth -- have done so because of what Bae and others charge is the restrictive nature of Japanese naturalization laws.<br><br>The laws require foreigners applying for Japanese citizenship to furnish proof of their 'assimilation into Japanese society' -- a nebulous demand that means 'we have to take Japanese names and renounce our Korean identities,' said Lee.Although the name change is not a legal requirement, Bae said many Koreans have been denied citizenship because their refusal to assume Japanese names was taken as evidence of their 'failure to assimilate.'<br><br>The State Department human rights report concurs, noting that 'only a few' Korean residents have become citizens under their own names.<br><br>'Our roots are here and we want to remain. But we are also proud of our heritage as Koreans. We don't want to lose that,' said Bae. ---<br><br>South Korea in recent years has lent vocal support to the Korean community's demands for equal rights, and especially for the abolition of a law requiring resident aliens to submit to periodic fingerprinting.<br><br>Fingerprinting is required of all foreign residents, but Koreans argue that their permanent place in Japanese society should exempt them. Korean community leaders doubt Chun will press the issue when other matters of more concern to South Korea -- technology transfer, trade and tensions with North Korea -- are also on the agenda.<br><br>Still others feel that Japanese prejudice against them is too deeply ingrained to be moved by soft, diplomatic words.<br><br>'The two governments will be concerned only about their own profit,' said Bae. 'For us, not much will change.' "

By Monday, the first planeloads of food and medical supplies were arriving from Moscow aboard special Aeroflot fights.<br><br>This correspondent and three others were the first foreign journalists to reach Aden after the fighting.

    "title": "Tunisia: A nation caught in the middle",
    "text": "TUNIS, Tunisia - The well-behaved little country of Tunisia lives in a rough neighborhood. Strategically situated in northernmost North Africa only 90 miles from Europe, it is a Florida-sized squiggle of land wedged between Algeria and Libya, two big countries with correspondingly large aspirations for regional leadership and with close ties to the Soviet bloc.<br><br>Under the 32-year reign of President Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia managed to keep both neighbors at bay and maintain a staunchly pro-Western foreign policy.<br><br>Since Bourguiba was ousted by his former interior minister, Zine Abidine Ben Ali last Nov. 7, however, the juggling act has become a little more difficult.<br><br>Tunisia has come under increasing pressure from Algeria to allow Libya to join a treaty of ''fraternity and concord'' that was signed in 1983 by Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania, Algeria's neighbor to the southwest. On the face of it, the treaty contains nothing objectionable. On the contrary, it would oblige Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi, in theory, to respect Tunisia's sovereignty and borders.<br><br>But admitting Libya to the treaty would make Morocco, the other pro-Western government of the Maghreb, as North Africa is known, feel isolated.<br><br>It would also upset the Reagan administration, which having failed to kill Gadhafi in the 1986 bombing of his barracks in Tripoli, has since tried to isolate him and objects to the treaty as a crack in his diplomatic quarantine.<br><br>''Sure the United States is putting pressure on us,'' Tunisian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Mestiri said in a recent interview. ''But we cannot say Gadhafi should not sign the treaty. The Algerians are saying we have to do something with Gadhafi, either unity or separation. This treaty would be separation.''<br><br>The urbane Tunisians would prefer to have nothing to do with their uncouth neighbor, who is forever proposing ''unity'' with other Arab governments - and lashing out at them when he is rebuffed.<br><br>Gadhafi long held a grudge against Bourguiba, who agreed to a merger with Libya in 1974 but changed his mind 24 hours later. Libyan agents were suspected of having a hand in riots in Tunis in 1978. Two years later, Libyan-trained commandos tried to foment an uprising in the remote central Tunisian city of Gafsa. But accidents of geography and demography have created mutual needs.<br><br>Libya, 10 times the size of Tunisia, has only half as many people. Blessed with greater oil riches, Libya has traditionally absorbed thousands of Tunisian workers, who would otherwise have swelled the already large ranks of the unemployed.<br><br>''We do need Libya and that is the problem,'' a senior Tunisian official said. In 1985, Gadhafi, facing an economic squeeze of his own because of falling oil revenues, wreaked havoc with his neighbor's economy by expelling more than 30,000 Tunisian workers over three months. Tunisia responded by breaking diplomatic relations. They were restored in December after Libya paid $10-million to a fund to reimburse workers with broken contracts and unfroze the assets of Tunisian businessmen. A visit to Tunisia by Gadhafi was expected soon after. But the Libyan leader abruptly canceled a trip scheduled for Jan. 16 when he discovered that the commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet was due in Tunis at the same time. He finally visited Tunisia this month.''We have no complexes in this country about our friendship with the United States,'' said Foreign Minister Mestiri, explaining why the visit of the American commander was not postponed to accommodate Gadhafi.<br><br>At the same time, the veteran diplomat acknowledged that relations with the United States have not been the same since President Reagan defended the October 1985 Israeli bombing of a Palestine Liberation Organization enclave outside Tunis in which a dozen Tunisians were killed.<br><br>''We do not want the damage to be permanent, provided the Americans help us, which is not the case,'' Mestiri continued. He complained that American aid to Tunisia had dropped so much in recent years that Tunisia would this year be paying more in debt service on past American loans than it would be receiving in new assistance. He called for forgiveness of military debts incurred in the late 1970s and 1980s, when Tunisia bought heavily from the United States to build up its small army against the Libyans.<br><br>''This is a catastrophe for us and for relations with the United States,'' the foreign minister said of the debt issue.<br><br>Mestiri's tough comments were in keeping with the new Tunisian emphasis on the country's ''Arab-Islamic character.''<br><br>Under Bourguiba, Tunisia's Western orientation was so strong that even an American diplomat in Tunis once described it as ''unnatural'' for a country of Tunisia's size, location and heritage.<br><br>In 1965, for example, Bourguiba, who had never appreciated the pan-Arabist views of then-Egyptian leader Gamel Abdel Nasser, shocked fellow Arabs by becoming the first regional leader to advocate a peaceful settlement with the Arabs' arch-enemy, Israel. In 1982, he allowed the PLO to move its political headquarters to Tunis after the organization was pushed out of Lebanon, but only did so under pressure from the United States.<br><br>''Under Bourguiba, people were under the impression that Tunisia was almost anti-Arab,'' Mestiri said. ''But now this is finished. . . . As a small country, we feel we can have good relations with everybody and play a positive role in our region and in the Middle East as a whole.''"

Malcolm Forbes, publisher, sportsman, self-promoter and impish capitalist, won.<br><br>In the end, his Chinese hosts, at times perplexed, astonished and annoyed by their guest's behavior, seemed more amused than anything else. Forbes caused more trouble in 2 weeks in China than any other distinguished American visitor since the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations. He flew a hot air balloon on a forbidden flight over Peking, accidentally penetrated a high-security military base, crashed into a brick wall and kept a company of officials racing around China after him, chiefly to shout, 'No, Mr. Forbes, you can't do that.'<br><br>He reacted to the word 'no' like a bull charging a red cape. But a sense of humor and a little help from friends always seemed to smooth things out.<br><br>For Forbes also had what the Chinese call 'guanxi' -- connections.<br><br>His visit was arranged by industrialist Armand Hammer, who got Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's personal approval for the the Malcolm Forbes motorcycle and balloon U.S.-China amity tour.<br><br>Though there is some question whether he contributed to U.S.-China amity or took advantage of it, Forbes said he and the five Americans with him 'had a ball.' The Chinese were forgiving enough to invite him back again -- though they did not suggest a date.<br><br>Forbes arrived in China Oct. 5 and headed for Xian in the center of the country, his launching pad for a 1,500- mile, 12-day journey to Peking with five matching motorcycles and the 74-foot-tall multi-colored Forbes friendship balloon.<br><br>He arranged a ballooning demonstration at the Xian sports stadium to delight his Chinese hosts. But delight turned to something close to horror when they saw Forbes and several assistants ascend up and over the stadium wall.<br><br>'We got all these frantic calls over the walkie-talkie saying 'would we please come down at once,'' Forbes said. 'I tried to explain to them that landing a balloon is not as easy as taking off in one.'<br><br>Forbes proved that several minutes later when he crashed into the top of an unmortared brick wall -- doing more damage to the wall than the gondola -- as he thudded to a landing in a nearby field.<br><br>Dressed in black motorcycle leathers and matching red vests, the Forbes team set out from Xian Oct. 8 with the balloon in two for a zig-zagging journey across central China.<br><br>They covered country seldom seen by tourists, but any notion they were seeing the 'real' China was quickly dispelled by the shrieking sirens of the police cars that preceded them all the way.<br><br>They slept in hotels where they could and tents where they couldn't and passed through towns where people thought 'the balloon was a satellite and the Harley Davidsons some sort of atomic weapons,' Forbes said. They arrived in Peking Oct. 19.<br><br>After the requisite banquets, a news conference and an impulsive midnight meeting with visiting Pakistani President Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq, Forbes got up early on the morning of the 20th and roared out to theGreat Wall to again float his balloon.<br><br>But mindful of what had happened in Xian, the Chinese refused to allow him to untie the tether this time.<br><br>'Maybe tomorrow,' Forbes told a reporter trying to overcome his terror long enough to interview him from the back of his motorcycle as they roared down a mountain road to Peking.<br><br>The next day, Forbes inflated his balloon once more for a group of athletes at a stadium outside Peking, giving them rides up to the length of the tether and down again.<br><br>When China's champion javelin thrower climbed into the gondola, Forbes glanced down at the ring of suspicious security men and untied the tether.<br><br>'No free flight, no free flight,' they shouted as Forbes and his startled guest drifted up and over the city.<br><br>About 15 minutes later, Forbes' voice crackled over the walkie-talkie. 'I dont know where we landed, but there are cannons pointed at us.'<br><br>Forbes had put down in the middle of a restricted army base. Within seconds he was surrounded by delighted soldiers and a worried commander who kept gesturing for him to take off again. Forbes presented him with a balloon-shaped commemorative pin and took his picture.<br><br>'It wasn't to be naughty and it wasn't to be unfriendly,' he told his hosts later that night at a farewell banquet. 'It was just to demonstrate that ballooning is a wonderful sport.'<br><br>Forbes admitted he liked all the publicity, but insisted the reason he did all he did was his love of motorcycling and ballooning and his desire to be the first to do both in China.<br><br>'Also I had a ball.'<br><br>Judging from the laughter around the banquet tables on his last night in Peking, his Chinese hosts did too.

The Moslem offensive on chic and predominantly Christian uptown Beirut was on.<br><br>In the six months since Beirut's vicious civil war between rival right-wing Christian and left-wing Moslem militias began, the fighting has slowly spread from the powderkeg eastern suburbs to the now-ruined downtown commercial center and, over the past few days, into the high-rise residential quarters of Ras Beirut.<br><br>Almost everyone has his own private horror story to tell of being trapped under fire, of huddling in basements or beneath beds as the rockets and mortars pound in or of being kidnaped by armed gangs and roughly interrogated.<br><br>A group of five Swedish, Danish and French diplomats were dragged from the hotel where they had taken refuge Friday night by masked leftist Moslem Nasserites who, in a spree of destruction, shot up the lobby and dining room and then tossed in several sticks of dynamite.<br><br>The diplomats were released several hours later but, in the words of a guest who was hiding upstairs at the time, \"It was like suddenly being hurled into hell. Everybody felt for certain he would die.\"<br><br>This correspondent was among those taken prisoner by Nasserites Sunday as I was trying to reach my apartment near the Holiday Inn. Finally, after nearly two hours, they let us leave, satisfied that I wasn't, as one of them put it, \"an American spy.\"<br><br>We edged along the smoking streets to my apartment building which had been taken over by a dozen or so Phalangists armed with machine guns.<br><br>I hurriedly packed a few of my own belongings, grabbed a pet cat and ran down the street.

    "text": "NEW YORK &mdash; The General Assembly will begin an emergency session on the Palestinian question tomorrow that its sponsors predict will bring about a \"qualitative\" increase in Israel's isolation.<br><br>However, Western Europeans who have been the target of an Arab diplomatic campaign indicated that they were unlikely to support the relatively hard-line resolution being drafted.<br><br>The draft calls for Israel to start withdrawing to its pre-1967 borders by Nov. 15 and authorizes Secretary General Kurt Waldheim to establish the necessary \"machinery\" to arrange and supervise the withdrawal and later, to turn over the relinquished Arab territory to the Palestine Liberation Organization.<br><br>The resolution is sponsored by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, a General Assembly panel made up primarily of Arab nations and those calling themselves nonaligned.<br><br>Compared to Earlier Vote<br><br>One Western European diplomat suggested that the outcome of the session would resemble the vote on a similar resolution at the last regular General Assembly session in 1979: \"117 for, but they won't have America and they won't have Europe, so it means nothing.\"<br><br>The diplomat said he doubted the Europeans would go beyond the declaration by the Common Market heads of state in Venice last month, recognizing the Palestinians' right to self-determination within a negotiated settlement and saying the P.L.O. should be \"associated\" with any negotiations.<br><br>The United States opposed calling the session, which is expected to last five days, and the chief American delegate, Donald F. McHenry, will be absent. A spokesman said Mr. McHenry will fly to Botswana tommorrow for the funeral of its President, Sir Seretse Khama. He is to remain in Africa until the weekend and then vacation until Aug. 4.<br><br>Israel Will Miss Opening<br><br>Israel termed the session \"illegal.\" It will not attend the opening, officially because of a Jewish holiday, Tisha b'Av, but its chief delegate, Yehuda Z. Blum, has asked to speak on Wednesday.<br><br>The countries seeking the session originally planned to request it under the \"uniting for peace\" procedure, which allows the General Assembly to recommend collective measures to deal with a threat to international peace and security when Security Council action has been blocked by a veto.<br><br>The American veto on April 30 of a Council resolution calling for a Palestinian state was cited by the sponsors in requesting the session.<br><br>But the sponsors dropped a specific reference to the procedure, according to a diplomat closely involved in the strategy, because so many Western nations questioned its appropriateness.<br><br>The procedure was introduced by the United States in 1950 after the American intervention in Korea. It has been used six times, most recently in January to get around a Soviet veto of a Council resolution condemning the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.<br><br>Request by Majority of Members<br><br>Assembly rules specify that emergency sessions \"shall be convened within 24 hours of the receipt by the Secretary General\" of a request for the session by a majority of the Security Council or the General Assembly. Requests for a session by Assembly members, which trickled in last week at the rate of one or two a day, poured in today. A United Nations spokesman said that by this morning, the required 77 requests had arrived.<br><br>At a news conference today, Mr. Blum, the Israeli delegate, derided the session as a \"planned emergency.\"He said it had been under discussion by the Arabs and their supporters since the meeting of nonaligned nations in Havana last year. \"One would have imagined that if an emergency had existed in April,\" Mr. Blum said, referring to the United States veto, \"the sponsors would have called for the session then.\"<br><br>He also asserted that \"to make sure that the session was not convened prematurely,\" many United Nations members left their replies \"not with the Secretary General but with the representative of that great nonaligned country, Cuba.\" A United Nations spokesman later confirmed that \"the Mission of Cuba delivered the bulk of the replies today.\"<br><br>Soviet Union Welcomes Distraction<br><br>Earlier, an American diplomat predicted privately that the session would be \"another public circus,\" with third-world diplomats berating the United States and Israel and the Soviet Union pleased at the distraction of international attention from its occupation of Afghanistan and the American-led boycott of the Moscow Olympic Games.<br><br>The Arabs did not expect Washington's support for the session. With American elections only three months off, said one United Nations diplomat familiar with the Arab position, \"the U.S. wouldn't vote for a resolution even if you wrote the Bible into it.\""

    "title": "SOVIET UNION IS LETTING ITS ARMENIAN PEOPLE GO",
    "text": "Call it poetic justice, or just history's perversity, that the dispersion of the Armenian people in the face of long persecution has endowed many Soviet Armenians with Moscow's main prerequisite for emigration - having relatives outside the U.S.S.R.<br><br>Meeting this requirement does not guarantee an exit visa, as Soviet Jews have learned. This year, however, Soviet authorities, while cutting Jewish emigration, are letting thousands of Armenians go.<br><br>The majority are emigres twice over, people who fled to the Soviet Union to escape persecution in the Middle East but who apparently did not find in Soviet Armenia, for all its 3 million ethnic comrades, the national homeland they had envisioned. Many say they applied for passports years ago and do not know why they are being allowed out now.<br><br> Soviet authorities have refused comment on the reasons, but Western diplomats and other observers have several theories: a desire by Moscow to show Soviet Jews and their supporters in the West that quiet requests for family reunification will succeed where public protest fails; a wish to purge malcontents before the Summer Olympics next week; concern about potential troublemakers in Soviet Armenia, which borders Turkey and Iran.<br><br>The emigrants principal destination is the United States. American diplomats in Moscow, who issued visas to about 3,000 Armenians from 1976 to 1978, have issued 4,000 since January and expect to top 7,000 for the year. Other Soviet Armenians may join relatives in Canada, Lebanon and France, which has slightly fewer than the United States' Armenian population, estimated at between 450,000 and 600,000.<br><br>Ninety percent of the Armenian immigrants to the United States follow the route of William Saroyan's parents to California, where Armenians have become numerous - there are more than 100,000 in metropolitan Los Angeles alone - and influential. The state Attorney General, George Deukmajian, is an Armenian-American and a likely Republican candidate for Governor in 1982.<br><br>The New York area also has a sizable Armenian population of about 70,000, according to the Armenian General Benevolent Union, a social welfare group. Many live in Queens, others in New Jersey's Bergen County. Sam Azadian, whose official title is ombudsman to the New York City Department of Transportation, but who has served as an unofficial liaison between the Armenian community and three mayoral administrations, said most of the newcomers to New York were from Lebanon and Iran. There, after the revolution, he said the 300,000 Armenian-Iranians \"found themselves Christians again caught in a rising Moslem fervor.\"<br><br>Beirut, with 200,000 people crammed into its small Armenian quarter, is still widely considered the capital of Armenians in exile. However, thousands fled in the mid-1970's, their neutrality in the civil war between Lebanese Moslems and Maronite Catholics proving no shield from the devastation.<br><br>Many of the Beirut emigres came to Canada, according to Levon Hasserjian, head of Canada's Armenian National Committee. Mr. Hasserjian said there are about 32,000 Armenians in Canada now, twothirds of them in the Montreal area.<br><br>\"Among Armenians,\" said Victor Ajamian, an accountant who was born in Syria and now lives in Toronto, \"Canada has a reputation for being a free, fair and stable land.\"<br><br>Dreaming of a Free Armenia<br><br>From 1918 to 1920, before it was reabsorbed by Turkey and Russia, Armenia was fleetingly independent. There persists a dream of a free Armenia among many exiles. Lucig Danielian, executive director of the Western region of the Armenian National Committee, said Armenians differ from many other immigrant groups because \"they keep the idea alive of someday returning to their homeland.\"<br><br>Like the Jews and the Kurds, the Armenians are an ancient people whose enduring sense of nationhood has been honed by persecution. Their ancestral homeland, at the neck of Asia Minor between the Black and Caspian Seas, was frequently divided. Relative autonomy, when it came, was at the sufferance of neighboring powers, first Rome and Parthia, later the Ottoman Empire and Persia and finally, Russia and the Ottoman Turks.<br><br>In the 19th century, it was natural that the Armenians, Christians from the 4th century, would look toward the Orthodox tsars of Russia for protection from the Moslem Turks and Persians. Relations with the Turks worsened after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. At the turn of the century, while Jews were leaving Russia, thousands of Armenians emigrated there from Turkey, also fleeing pogroms.<br><br>Far worse was to come. In 1915, Turkey, regarding Armenians as in collusion with its enemies, decided to deport the whole Armenian population of nearly two million. More than a million Armenians are believed to have died or been massacred in the deportation and its aftermath. (It was partly the world's acceptance of their deaths that Hitler used to rationalize the invasion of Poland in the next World War: \"Who still talks nowadays of the extermination of the Armenians?\" he is reported to have said to Hermann Goering.) Every year on April 24, the day in 1915 when the Turks killed 200 Armenian leaders in a prelude to the genocide, Armenian communities all over the world commemorate the dead.<br><br>Today, there are about 60,000 Armenians left in Turkey. Gradually, they are leaving too. United States consular officials say the majority of Turkish citizens seeking American visas are Armenian.<br><br>The Armenians say they do not fear new massacres but they do fear persecution in retaliation for Armenian terrorism against Turkish missions abroad. Since 1973, Armenian guerrillas have claimed the assassination of 12 Turks, primarily diplomats, as well as more than a hundred bombings and other attacks on Turkish targets. They are also leaving for economic reasons - to escape 100 percent inflation and more than 20 percent unemployment -and to avoid getting caught in the crossfire between Turkish rightists and leftists whose vendettas have claimed nearly 2,000 lives this year.<br><br>New York Times correspondents in Ankara, Moscow, Toronto and Los Angeles contributed to this article."

    "text": "Those who have wondered whether Iran's Islamic revolution could make do without Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini may soon find out. Although Iranian officials last week dismissed reports that the Ayatollah was dying as so much imperialist Zionist propaganda, the Iranian press agency said the 81-year-old imam would be replaced by a ruling council of between three and five members.<br><br>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is expected to be replaced by ruling council. Elections for the members, the agency said, would be held by May.<br><br>Last weekend, the office of the Ayatollah said he was going into two weeks seclusion. In Paris, an exiled leader of the Iranian opposition said he had been told by travelers from Teheran that the imam was either dying or incapacitated to such an extent \"that he is dead for all intents and purposes.\"<br><br>It is questionable whether even a multiple leadership could fill the Ayatollah's place as spiritual leader of Iran and arbiter of its revolution. Fighting reportedly continues between Government forces and guerrillas opposed to the clergy's dominance of state affairs. Meanwhile, the war with Iraq is in its 17th month.<br><br>The economy is deteriorating, in part because of the worldwide oil glut. Trying to lure buyers, Iran last week cut oil prices for the second time this month. It will sell light crude for $32.20 a barrel, compared to the official Saudi price of $34. It will sell heavy grade oil at $30.30 in an apparent effort to undercut Kuwait, which sells similar oil for $32.30. Industry sources said Iranian exports were 700,000 barrels a day, half its target."

    "text": "SHANGHAI &mdash; It is 10 o'clock at night in Shanghai and the ghosts are starting to come out.<br><br>Down at the Peace Cafe, the old men who once played in Jimmy King's Orchestra are swinging into a rusty rendition of \"Chattanooga Choo-Choo.\"<br><br>Outside in the darkness, lovers stroll arm in arm along the waterfront, whispering under the shadows of the stately buildings that line the Bund, once Shanghai's most fashionable avenue.<br><br>Built by the British in the last century, these buildings look better in the darkness now. For, despite their granite solidity, they are fragments of a dream of empire and elegance that has no place in the daylight of modern China.<br><br>At night, steeped in the gloom they cast upon the dimly-lit street, it is possible to imagine that these buildings still house the powerful banks, trading companies and consulates for which they were built. Names spring to mind -- the Khadoories and the Sassoons, families that made their fortunes along this street.<br><br>Up the avenues and down the sidestreets linger more ghosts: apparitions of drunken sailors fighting in Blood Alley, of China Dolls and European princesses, intellectuals and opium addicts. Shanghai was known as \"the Paris of the Orient\" then.<br><br>But there are other, grimmer ghosts as well. Ghosts of children who worked 14-hour days in sweatshops, ghosts of the destitute selling their babies in baskets in the marketplace. If they were not sold by nightfall, their bodies could be found in the canals at daybreak. Better death by drowning than by starvation.<br><br>Dawn breaks and dispels these ghosts, forcing memories to retreat before an onslaught of bicycles, buses and shuffling crowds of people on their way to work in the municipal offices that the great buildings now house.<br><br>For today Shanghai is more like Liverpool than Paris -- a city of 12 million people and 8,000 factories, the pacesetter and backbone of Chinese industry.<br><br>Shanghai is China's largest city and its gateway to the world. Through its port passed 90 million tons of cargo last year. Shanghai earned one-sixth of China's foreign exchange and accounted for one-eighth of its industrial production, a figure that will increase when the Baoshan steel complex, the largest in the world, begins production next year.<br><br>Shanghai has always set the pace for Chinese industry. Its consumer products, from bicycles to washing machines, are so eagerly sought throughout the rest of China that unscrupulous manufacturers in other cities frequently get caught counterfeiting Shanghai brand-names.<br><br>But if Shanghai has led China's economy, it has been held back by its politics. The ravages of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, which began in Shanghai, have left deep scars. Factories are woefully outdated and the pollution is alarming. The once-lovely Huangpu, the river beside the Bund, smells like a sewer.<br><br>As in other parts of China, the communists have eliminated starvation, greatly improved medical care and raised literacy rates. But the overwhelming majority of Shanghai's residents still live in filthy, rat-infested slums without heat or hot water.<br><br>\"The European architecture is charming,\" says a Western businessman who lives in Shanghai. \"But if you go off the main streets, into the alleys where these 12 million people live, you find they're residing in lean-tos with no hot water and five to a room. If you had a dog you liked, you'd treat it better than that.\"<br><br>Shanghai enjoys more autonomy than other cities and can negotiate directly with foreigners, bypassing the stodgy central planners of Peking. Yet it has had trouble attracting foreign investment.<br><br>Foreigners blame restrictive regulations and the \"arrogance and greed\" of local officials for the problems they face doing business in Shanghai. \"They have been slow to realize that Westerners need to make a profit. They think they know everything about business and they're too proud to take advice,\" says one businessman.<br><br>There are signs this attitude is changing. Shanghai has promised more liberal joint venture regulations and recently gave approval to the 3M Company of Minnesota to establish China's first wholly foreign-owned enterprise.<br><br>For all its problems, Shanghai is still China's most cosmopolitan city. The mercantile spirit remains strong and the clothing stores along Nanjing Road do a brisk business catering to the young. Boys with wavy, permed hair and girls in tight-fitting jeans are a common sight, especially in the crowded cafes whose young patrons affect Western tastes by sipping coffee instead of the traditional Chinese tea.<br><br>Foreigners are constantly approached by Chinese wanting to know more about where they come from, how much they money make and whether it is true that every American owns a car. The kids listen to the Voice of America and say how much they would like to visit the United States.<br><br>There is a certain restlessness among them not sensed elsewhere in China. \"They know more about the world and what's being denied to them,\" a Western diplomat says.<br><br>Shanghai's youth are among China's best educated and on them are pinned the country's hopes for modernization.<br><br>\"They can do it,\" says a Western diplomat, \"but only if they lighten the bureaucracy weighing them down.\" Only then will Shanghai finally be able to exorcise its ghosts."

Starting Tuesday, the Friendship Store went on the \"responsibility system,\" the official Xinhua news agency announced.<br><br>The system, already widely applied to agriculture, aims to boost productivity and performance by restoring work incentives eroded by Maoist egalitarian ethics.<br><br>It makes managers responsible for profits and losses and allows them to retain a percentage of the profits for reinvestment and bonuses.<br><br>Store manager Liu Jinbin promised the system will change now that the store is responsible for its own financial affairs.<br><br>\"Standards for judging the quality of service will be worked out,\" he said. \"The quality of service and management will be improved.\"<br><br>Besides being responsible for earnings, the store will adopt a \"floating wage\" system linking 20 percent of each worker's salary to job function, courtesy and efficiency.<br><br>\"Those who violate discipline and refuse education will be penalized with warnings, demotions and even discharge,\" Xinhua said.

    "title": "Hijackers kill second hostage on Kuwaiti jet",
    "text": "LARNACA, Cyprus - The hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet shot and killed another hostage Monday at Larnaca airport and threw his body from the plane to press their demands for fuel.<br><br>The body of the victim, believed to be one of three Kuwaiti military officers on board the flight, was tossed onto the airport apron shortly after the expiration of one of several deadlines the hijackers set during the day for the Boeing 747 to be refueled.<br><br>Announcing his death, the hijackers threatened to \"take more dangerous steps\" unless their demands were met. Later, after nearly 3 1/2 tense hours of silence, they put one of the hostages on the radio to plead with Cypriot authorities for fuel.<br><br>\"My name is Fadel Marzouk el Oteibi,\" the hostage said in Arabic. \"Please tell my parents I am all right so far. But the hijackers say they will kill the passengers if you don't give us fuel. Please give us fuel.\"<br><br>The man killed Monday was the second hostage to be slain by the hijackers since the Kuwait Airways jetliner arrived in Larnaca's small seaside airport Friday night following a harrowing flight across the Middle East from Iran. Another man, also identified as a military officer, was killed Saturday, also to dramatize the demand for fuel.<br><br>Monday's slaying appeared to come as a deeper shock to Cypriot authorities because it also effectively killed the hope that negotiators earlier had raised for an imminent end to the hijacking, which began a week ago.<br><br>Details of the negotiations, being conducted at plane-side by a joint delegation from Cyprus and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), have been kept secret. But a Cypriot spokesman suggested to reporters that an \"extremely important\" message conveyed to the hijackers early Monday might break the stalemate and lead to the release of the more than 40 hostages still on board.<br><br>Those hopes were set back later in the morning, however, when the hijackers set the first of three new deadlines for the plane to be refueled, saying that they planned to fly it next to \"a neutral country.\"<br><br>They accused the Cypriots of failing to reciprocate for a \"goodwill gesture\" they made Saturday when they released one passenger shortly after killing the first security guard, who Cypriot authorities said appeared to have been severely tortured before being killed.<br><br>This time, they said, \"we will kill a personality related to the unjust Kuwaiti regime\" if the refueling did not start within one hour.<br><br>Three members of Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family are among the more than 40 hostages still on board the blue-and-white Boeing 747, and the hijackers' threat appeared to be a reference to them.<br><br>A few minutes before each deadline was about to expire, the control tower radioed the plane to say that the negotiators wanted to talk to the hijackers. The hijackers agreed, but by the time the second deadline approached, the somewhat chilling politeness with which they had been conversing with the control tower showed signs of cracking.<br><br>\"I want a yes or no answer,\" one of the hijackers snapped. \"I want an answer now (on refueling.)\"  In another sign of the mounting tension, the hijackers refused to let the negotiators stand on the mobile staircase used in previous rounds of plane-side negotiations.<br><br>At their insistence, Malaz Abdo, the PLO official involved in the talks, approached the plane alone and on foot and spoke to the hijackers from the ground with the aid of a megaphone.<br><br>Soon after he left, the control tower asked the terrorists for another 30 minutes to consider their latest demands.<br><br>\"Okay,\" one of the terrorists replied, \"but 30 minutes will be the final extension. After 30 minutes, either we receive the fuel or you receive a corpse.\"<br><br>Abdo went out to the plane again shortly after that deadline expired and spoke briefly with the terrorists. A few minutes later, the airplane's front exit door opened briefly and a body, clad in tan boxer shorts and a blue T-shirt, toppled to the apron.<br><br>\"We have executed a Kuwaiti officer,\" one of the hijackers announced in a monotone voice. \"We also reconfirm that the craft must be refueled immediately, immediately, before we take more dangerous steps.\"<br><br>The hijacker signed off and the control tower lapsed into silence. The body remained on the apron for nearly 30 minutes before an   ambulance came to fetch it.<br><br>Part of the delay appeared to be caused by the arrival of another plane, which landed and disgorged a group of Scandinavian tourists who shuffled into the arrival hall without appearing to notice either the hijacked jet or the body sprawled on the ground only a few hundred yards away.<br><br>Indeed, one of the strangest aspects of the bizarre drama at Larnaca has been the business-as-usual atmosphere in which the airport has been operating even as the tragedy has unfolded within sight of crowds of vacationers. Demands are made, deadlines set and bloodied bodies tossed to the ground like jettisoned cargo as tour groups come and go and passengers argue with ticket-counter officials over double bookings and lost luggage.<br><br>Security, which had been extremely discreet, was stepped up noticeably Monday, however, with two armored personnel carriers taking up positions a few hundred yards ahead of and in back of the plane.<br><br>The terrorists, who are believed to number between five and eight, all armed with pistols and hand grenades, hijacked the jetliner April 5 on a homeward-bound flight from Bangkok to demand the release of 17 Shiite Moslem extremists imprisoned in Kuwait.<br><br>They have not identified themselves, but they are believed to be members of one of the Shiite Moslem terrorist groups that are holding Western hostages in Lebanon.<br><br>Kuwait has refused to consider their demands and, although a Kuwaiti government delegation is on hand at Larnaca Airport, there has been no sign of it taking an active part in the negotiations so far.<br><br>Instead, the talks have focused on the hijackers' demands for more fuel and technical problems related to keeping the aircraft's air-conditioning system running and supplying the plane with food.<br><br>The hijackers turned down an offer of lunch Sunday but late Monday evening radioed a request for \"100 pieces of bread, 50 pieces of cake and 50 Pepsi-Colas.\"<br><br>The control tower responded by asking if they would also care for something more nourishing, such as cheese. \"No,\" came the answer. \"No cheese.\"<br><br>A little while later, the hijackers asked for some \"Maalox suspension\" for one of the passengers who was said to be suffering from an ulcer. The tower asked the hijackers if they would consider releasing the ulcer sufferer, but the answer came back, \"Negative.\"<br><br>The hijackers have received support from other groups.<br><br>On Sunday, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction in Lebanon threatened to kill American and French hostages it holds if any attempt   is made to storm the plane.<br><br>Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, made the threat in a statement   delivered to the Reuters news agency in Beirut along with photographs of American Terry Anderson and Frenchman Jean-Paul Kauffmann, both journalists kidnapped in 1985.<br><br>Monday, kidnappers of another American, Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, threatened to hang him.<br><br>A communique issued in Beirut by the pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said: \"We shall put the American agent Col. William Higgins on the gallows if anyone attempts to attack the plane.\" No photo accompanied the communique.<br><br>Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., served with a U.N. observer group in southern Lebanon and was kidnapped Feb. 17."

    "text": "TRIPOLI, Libya — The back of what used to be the French Embassy in Tripoli is still missing its windows. Rusty metal rods protrude from the crumbling side of a villa next door, chunks of concrete hanging from some of them like rotten fruit.<br><br>Nearly three years after the United States and Libya last came to blows, the wounds of that confrontation are still glaringly and deliberately apparent in Bin Ashur, an upper-middle class neighborhood accidentally hit when the United States bombed Tripoli in the middle of the night of April 15, 1986.<br><br>“I guess the government wants the people to remember,” said Abdul Razak Tonnelli, an 18-year-old student who lives across the street from the ruins. “Now the Americans may hit again,” he said. “It’s a big problem.”<br><br>Some Libyans, remembering the night the U.S. F-111s roared in from the sea to avenge Libyan involvement in a terrorist bombing in Berlin, have left the capital for second homes in the countryside or to visit relatives in other cities.<br><br>The Bab al-Aziziya barracks of Libyan leader\nCol. Moammar Gadhafi, where the wreckage of.\nhis residence, purposely hit in 1986, also remains unrepaired, has reportedly been further fortified in case the Americans try again to kill the Libyan leader.<br><br>Reporters touring the city Friday saw extra troops posted around the barracks and warplanes on alert on a side runway of Tripoli’s international airport. Gadhafi himself has kept out of public view since Wednesday.<br><br>But the mood in the seaside capital, while hardly cheery, was far from panicked. Tripoli was not deserted and its inhabitants, compared to the lead-up with to 1986 bombing, seemed comparatively relaxed.<br><br>“There's some underlying tension but nothing like 1986,” said a European diplomat. “Security forces have been put on alert, and some\nreserves were called back to the barracks.”<br><br><figure class='figure'><img class='media' src='images/gadhafi.png'><figcaption>Gadhafi has kept himself out of public view.</figcaption></figure>On Friday, the weekly holiday in Moslem\ncountries, young men lounged at snack bars\ntucked into peeling Italianate\nbuildings along the colonnaded boulevards built here by Libya’s former colonial rulers. Some of them were reading the latest issue of the major government daily,\n<em>Al Jamahiriya</em>, which ran a front-page cartoon showing President Reagan with a bomb in his hand.<br><br>Just off the city’s central Green Square, where Gadhafi likes to address his people, a flea market he allowed to open six months ago was crowded with Libyans and East Europeans and Filipino migrant workers.<br><br>“No, I’m not frightened,” said a Moroccan peddler who was selling Turkish blue jeans for\n$30 a pair. ‘Besides, business is too good.”<br><br>Should the United States attack, the presumed target this time would not be Tripoli itself, but a factory at the desert town of Rabta 40 miles south of the city that Washington says is potentially the biggest producer of chemical\nweapons in the Third World.<br><br>The Libyans deny this and say the plant is in\nfact intended to produce medicine. Libyan doctors and nurses and members of the local “Peoples Congress” have been sitting in at the factory, according to the Libyan news agency, JANA, to protest the American threat to destroy the plant.<br><br>To bolster its claims that the plant is harmless, Libya promised to show the facility to foreign journalists who descended on Tripoli over the past three days.<br><br>But instead of the plant at Rabta, two busloads of reporters, who were not told their destination until they had traveled more than an hour from Tripoli, were taken to the Roman ruins at Leptis Magna for a bit of sightseeing. \nThey were kept out of the capital until after dark.<br><br>Appearing later before a crowd of angry reporters in Tripoli’s Grand Hotel, Libyan Information Minister Rajad Abu Dabous promised a tour of the plant today.<br><br>\n“We are innocent. It is a pharmaceutical\nplant and nothing more,’ he said. He added,\nhowever, that “nothing in international law\nprevents a country from setting up a plant to\nproduce whatever it wants.”<br><br>\nAs in past confrontations, the Libyans are portraying themselves as the victims of American aggression following the loss of two of their\nwarplanes in a dogfight Wednesday over the\nMediterranean.<br><br>But while Gadhafi has vowed to “meet\nchallenge with challenge,” his government has\nsought to keep the conflict from escalating.<br><br>Instead of threatening to send “suicide squads” to assassinate Americans, as the Libyans did in 1986, they have appealed for diplomatic support from fellow Arabs and at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council.<br><br>There has not been a public funeral for the two pilots the Libyans have privately admitted were killed in Wednesday’s dogfight.<br><br>“The Libyans are genuinely afraid that the\nAmericans are going to go after wider targets,\nand they want to defuse the situation,” the\nEuropean diplomat said. The diplomat, who\nattributed the dogfight to carelessness or bravado on the part of the Libyan pilots, noted that Gadhafi has tried hard in the past year to repair his image as a reckless adventurer.<br><br>“He’s being careful not to damage his image again,” the diplomat said.<br><br>In Bin Ashur, however, it is the U.S. image\nthat seems to need repairing. The student,\nstanding on a weedy knoll covering what had\nbeen a bomb crater, said the Untied States was\nnot really interested in destroying the chemical factory but really wanted instead “to hit the\nLibyan government.”<br><br>Asked why the United States would want to do this, he said, “because they are imperialists.”"

The suspicion that Iraq continues to hoard chemical and biological weapons is cited by the Bush administration as grounds to threaten that nation with an invasion. By that logic, North Korea — which the CIA says already has one or two nuclear bombs, as well as long-range ballistic missiles — might be a more apt target than Iraq.

But David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security and an expert on North Korea's nuclear program, says the evidence shows the North Koreans have purchased equipment to make gas centrifuges, which are used to produce weapons-grade material from ordinary uranium.<br><br>“The administration will confront the same problem as the Clinton administration but with fewer options,” says Joel Wit, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The administration may think North Korea will back down, but I'm not sure they will.”<br><br>Contributing: John Diamond"

    "text": "BEIJING &mdash; For the one person out of five on earth\nwho is a Chinese peasant, life could only\nget better after Chairman Mao’s time;\nand it has. (China’s new census says that\nthere are 1.008 billion Chinese of whom\nfour fifths are peasants.) Some of the\nimprovements have been dramatic. Encouraged by higher prices for their products and by what amounts to an abandonment of collective farming, Chinese\npeasants have doubled their incomes in\nfive years (to $130 a head) and boosted\nthe living standards of the nation. Chinese newspapers are full of self-congratulatory articles about the record harvest\nexpected this year.<br><br><figure class='figure'><img class='media' src='images/yuan-while-you-can.png'><figcaption>Collectively, they are now working for themselves.</figcaption></figure>China has become a land of relative plenty as a result of the decision to “first\nfeed the people, second build the country’, as Mr Hu Yaobang, the party’s\nsecretary-general, put it at last month’s\nparty congress. The prices the state pays\nfor agricultural goods were raised by\n25%. Three years ago peasants were\nencouraged to cultivate private plots, and\nthe size of these plots was doubled. Then,\nin 1980, production teams, consisting of a\nfew dozen families, were given responsibility for deciding what to plant and how\nto allocate the surplus.<br><br>Under this so-called “responsibility\nsystem”, which has a counterpart in industry, the more a peasant produces, the\nmore he earns. At first, only poorer\nregions were allowed to devolve responsibility for decision-making and profit-taking down from the team to individual\nfarm families. But now the “household\nresponsibility system’’ has spread to 45%\nof China’s production teams. It is not\nquite private farming, since nobody owns\nhis land, but it is near enough to give\npeasants a big new incentive to work.<br><br>The trouble is that the incentive system\nis not without costs. It has tempted profitseeking farmers to shift land out of grain\nand into cash crops such as cotton and\ntobacco. The government has had to\noffer new incentives—access to fertilisers, farm tools, even bicycles—to stop\npeasants reducing cereal acreage. Farmers tend to use less fertiliser because it\ncosts so much. Seeing the new value of\nextra manpower, families are ignoring\nthe one-child norm of the family planners\nand keeping their sons away from army\nrecruiters. And, fearing a return to “eating out of a big pot”, peasants are reluctant to look beyond the next harvest.<br><br>A radio broadcast in Guangxi province\nrecently noted that peasants were “willing to do only things that benefit them in\nthe short term and do not want to undertake projects from which they will benefit\nafter several years”. Peasants also fear\nthat prices and profit margins may be cut.\nThe government has announced that\nthere will be no increase in the prices of\nfarm commodities for the next few years.\nThe press has been complaining about\nthe high cost of subsidies on food. Some\nobservers think that subsidies will be cut\nbut one noted that “Chinese farmers\nhave always taken it in the neck and are\njust worrying that it will happen again”.<br><br>Rural party officials who have been\nstripped of their power over production\ndecisions frequently try to sabotage the\nresponsibility system. In ome case of\nspiteful over-zealousness Officials in Anhui province arrested Wang Quanjing,\nwhose six-member household had earned\n3,000 yuan ($1,500) last.year, mostly by\nproducing baskets, tea, herbal medicines\nand bamboo. Mr Wang’s supposed crime,\nbesides making so much money, was\nhiring people outside his family to help\nhim to do it. This is now legal but still\nunusual. A local radio noted that since\nthe employees had all volunteered to\nwork and been paid for it, “such a\npractice cannot be looked upon as exploitation”. Still, it took the intervention of a\ncounty party official before Mr Wang was\nreleased.<br><br>Inequalities—between families and between regions—are bound to increase so\nlong as China allows farmers to demonstrate differences of intelligence, application and luck. The resentment this\nleads to should be containable so long as\nthe profits are coming in. The worry is\nthat Chinese agriculture may be entering\na period of diminishing returns. Output\nhas risen by nearly a third since 1977. But\nthis year it will go up by only 4%, even if\nthe harvest tops the 1979 record of 337m\ntonnes of grain. Experts say the rate of\nincrease will continue to decline because\nall the easy gains have already been\nmade. Chinese farmers may be right to\ngrab a quick yuan while they can."

And so he has.<br><br>Neither Mr. Sadat, nor anyone\nelse, can yet know what his visit\nwill mean for Middle East peace&mdash;\nor for his own political and personal fortunes. But the Egyptian\nPresident has by his presence in\nJerusalem implicitly recognized\nIsrael's existence and, as one\nIsraeli commented, “the whole\natmosphere has been psychologically transformed.”<br><br>Although there were hints about\nRumanian or Iranian go-betweens,\nthe trip, arranged with astonishing\nspeed thanks in part to the press\nand American television, appeared\nto have caught all parties to Middle East diplomacy, including\nWashington, by surprise.<br><br>Though popular opinion in Cairo\nseemed to support Mr. Sadat, the\nreaction from many Arab leaders,\nincluding members of Mr. Sadat’s\nCabinet, ranged from outrage to dismay\nHis Foreign Minister of four years, Ismail Fahmy, resigned. The leader of Syria, Hafez\nal-Assad, anxious that despite Mr.\nSadat’s disclaimers Egypt was\nplanning a separate peace with Israel, called the initiative dangerous and declared yesterday a day\nof mourning. The Palestine Liberation Organization, waiting for the\nSyrian reaction before commenting in full, then replied with predictable anger.<br><br>Some of the reaction was violent, with bombings and demonstrations at Egyptian offices in\nseveral capitals.<br><br>Far more important, however,\nwas the response from Saudi Arabia, bankroller to the belligerent\nArab states and Egypt in particular. After initial silence, the Saudis, who have often acted as mediators' in inter-Arab- quarrels,\nexpressed concern that Mr. Sadat\nwould split the Arab ranks, “Any\nmove with regard to a settlement,”\nthe Saudis’ cautioned, “must be\nwithin the framework of Arab\nunity.” The Soviet Union, fearing\nthat once again it would be bypassed in ‘Middle East diplomacy,\nwarned that Mr, Sadat’s “flirta_ion’’ with Israel could lead to\nwar.<br><br>In Washington, Carter Administration officials were concerned\nthat the Egyptian leader receive\ntangible concessions from Israel\nin return for his extraordinary\npersonal and political courage.\nOtherwise, they feared, he would\nbe isolated in the Arab world. Yet\nin a sense, Mr. Sadat’s vulnerability\nis a source of strength. Should he\nbe overthrown as a result of a futile visit to Jerusalem, the Israelis\nknow his successor would almost\ncertainly take a more hardline\nstance; peace prospects would be\ncrippled indefinitely.<br><br>United States officials said they\nwere urging Israel to compromise\non a formula for Palestinian representation at a Geneva conference, the main procedural question\nthat has stalled Middle East diplomacy for months.<br><br>Although the Sadat visit has, for\nthe moment, eclipsed all other initiatives, the principal obstacles to\npeace remain. At the core, as\nalways, are the Palestinians. The\nIsraeli Government continues to\nrefuse to even contemplate the\ncreation of a Palestinian state on\nthe West Bank ef Jordan which\nit considers Israel’s by biblical\nright.<br><br>Unlike most meetings between\nheads of state, where the texts of\ntreaties have been prepared by\nsubordinates in advance and the\nleaders need only initial them, Mr.\nSadat’s discussions with Prime\nMinister Menahem Begin of Israel\nare completely uncharted. Yet,\nwhatever the substance of the\ntalks, even as a gesture the visit\nis astonishing — Egypt remains\ntechnically at war with Israel.\nLow-level representatives of the\ntwo countries worked out the details of truce agreements in 1956\nand 1973 but all important negotiations have always been conducted second-hand.<br><br>Credit for the historic visit goes\nto Mr. Begin as well as to Mr.\nSadat. The Egyptian President,\nevidently frustated by the pace of\npreparations for Geneva and under\ndomestic economic pressure to at\nleast appear to be making\nprogress toward peace, suggested\nthe visit in an emotional speech\nbefore his Parliament 12 days ago.\nBut it was Prime Minister Begin,\nwith an equal flair for the dramatic, who seized upon the offer,\nwhich was discounted by most Israelis and many others as just so\nmuch rhetoric. Two days later, in\na broadcast on Israel’s Arabic\nradio station, he addressed a plea\nfor peace to the Egyptian people\nand told them that their leader\nwas welcome in Israel."

True, Yitzhak Rabin,\nIsrael’s prime minister, declined to put his\nsignature on the same bit of paper as Yasser\nArafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganisation, leaving that to his foreign\nminister, Shimon Peres, and Mahmoud\nAbbas, Mr Arafat’s number three. True too,\nMr Rabin had to be coaxed by Bill Clinton\ninto shaking Mr Arafat’s hand. No matter,\nthe sun shone on the White House lawn on\nSeptember 13th, the deal was made and everybody was deeply moved. As they were\nright to be.<br><br><figure class='figure'><img class='media' src='images/arafat.png'><figcaption>Star in the Senate</figcaption></figure>The Americans, who had little to do with\nthe negotiations that led up to the agreement, redeemed themselves as the perfect\nstage-managers for its public celebration.\nMr Clinton, the youngest man on the podium, projected an avuncular air, congratulating the children for making up their\nquarrel. He delivered an eloquent speech\nthat quoted from the Bible and the Koran,\nwove in his trademark themes of change\nand optimism and promised active American support in the days ahead.<br><br>A big element in this support is reassuring sceptical Israelis—and worried American Jews—that Israel’s agreement to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho, and allow a\ndegree of Palestinian self-rule in much of\nthe rest of the West Bank, will not jeopardise\nIsrael’s security. In his speech and at interviews, the president reiterated that this security is still a paramount American concern.\nHe strongly implied that Israel will continue to get its annual $3 billion (more than\na quarter of America’s bilateral foreign-aid)\ndespite budget concerns. Administration\nofficials have also indicated that they would\nlook favourably on Israeli requests for yet\nmore sophisticated weaponry.<br><br>The administration’s cosy relationship\nwith Israel appears to have been one of the\nreasons for the PLO’s decision to bypass the\nofficial talks in Washington and negotiate\nwith the Israelis in secret in Norway. Once\nthere, they found that Mr Rabin’s government was prepared to be more forthcoming\nthan allowed for in the “compromise”\ndrafts put out by the State Department.<br><br>The Jordanians, however, were happy to\nstay in Washington for their own negotiations. A framework for an Israel-Jordan\npeace treaty, essentially completed a year\nago but held up by Jordan until the breakthrough with the PLO, was signed at the\nState Department on September 14th. Mr\nClinton rewarded King Hussein with a\npromise of economic aid.<br><br>The Syrians, too, are sticking with the\nAmericans. Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, has offered to fly again to the\nregion after the Israelis have had a chance to\ndigest Palestinian developments. Another\npossibility is that Mr Peres will get together\nwith Farouk Sharaa, his Syrian counterpart,\nwhen the United Nations General Assembly opens shortly in New York.<br><br>The UN was the site of Mr Arafat’s only\nother visit to the United States, in 1974,\nwhen he appeared before the General Assembly with a gun on his hip; after that he\nwas barred from entry. This time, he put his\nsecurity in the hands of the American Secret\nService, and the man whom most Americans have for decades loved to hate, fear and\nderide was suddenly the star of Washington. The swiftness with which diplomatic\ntaboos tumbled, and the enthusiasm with\nwhich he was greeted by the political establishment, were remarkable even by the standards of this power-hungry city.<br><br>It used to be thought that it would be\nAmerica that would persuade Israel to accept the PLO. In fact it was the other way\nabout. So far America has only resumed the\n“dialogue” begun in 1988 and broken off in\n1990; Palestinian interests are represented\nin Washington by a Palestine Affairs Centre\nstaffed by American residents. But here was\nMr Arafat being received at the White\nHouse—where he held an unscheduled téte-a-téte with Mr Clinton in the basement map\nroom—and then passing on to the State Department, Congress and “Larry King Live”.\nAsked at a National Press Club lunch when\nhe expected that the United States would\nformally recognise the PLO, Mr Arafat replied: “We have already achieved it.”<br><br>In his first foray into American public\nrelations, Mr Arafat was an undeniable hit,\nespecially on Capitol Hill, where he spent\nthe day after the ceremony working the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives like a practised western politician.\nThe House Speaker, Tom Foley, pronounced him “a very engaging personality”. The Senate majority leader, George\nMitchell, said he was looking into the laws\nthat prohibit dealings with the PLO, so that\nthey could be changed.<br><br>America’s financial contribution to Palestinian development is certain to be measured only in millions, not the billions\ndoled out to Israel and Egypt ever since they\nsigned their peace treaty in 1979. But Washington will help to solicit contributions\nfrom Europe, Japan and wealthy Arabs.<br><br>On the evening of the signing ceremony, the American Jewish Congress and the National Association of Arab Americans cosponsored a reception at which Arabs and Jews chatted over the buffet tables and listened to Hebrew and Arabic folksongs.\nThey were told by Nabil Shaath, an American-educated businessman who has long been an adviser to Mr Arafat, that they had the choice of making the new Palestinian entity either a Singapore or a Somalia.<br><br>The first alternative is, of course, nonsense: there are still miles to go, even if local die-hards do not sabotage the effort, before Mr Arafat’s new sub-state escapes the living standards of the third world. But at least some Jewish Americans, who have supported Israel through thick and thin, are beginning to see the reasons for supporting its ex-enemies as well."

    "date": "June 5, 1988",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">BAGHDAD, Iraq — </span> <p>Buoyed by its biggest battlefield victories since the beginning of its 7 1/2-year-old war with Iran, Iraq is adopting a new and more aggressive strategy to force Iran into accepting a U.N.-sponsored peace settlement.</p>\n<p>But, despite indications that Iran’s war effort is encountering mounting difficulties, there is little likelihood of the conflict ending, or even winding down, in the near future, diplomats in Baghdad say.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, a new set of risks may be about to emerge, they say, because of reports that some Iraqi military strategists are pressing for the chance to cross the border to seize Iranian territory for the first time since the early days of the war.</p>\n<p>Until recently, all of this seemed quite impossible.</p>\n<p>Among Western military analysts in Baghdad, the most prevalent view of the war was that, although it was basically unwinnable by either side, time favored the Iranians, whose willingness to expend their greater manpower in costly human-wave offensives allowed them to nibble their way into Iraqi territory.</p>\n<p>The basic assessment among observers that neither side is strong enough to secure an outright victory has not changed. But over the last two months a series of startling Iranian setbacks, mirroring in part the deepening political chaos in Iran, is beginning to raise serious questions about Iran’s ability to continue waging an offensive war.</p>\n<p>The first suggestion that Iran’s revolutionary ardor might be cooling came when it failed to launch an expected winter offensive in the south this year. That was followed by the failure of a more limited offensive in the north which, after making initial gains, was blunted by Iraq’s ruthless use of poison gas.</p>\n<p>The confirmation that Iran was in serious difficulty came when, much to the surprise of foreign observers, Iraq swept into the Faw Peninsula in April, easily reclaiming that southernmost finger of Iraqi territory from the Iranian forces that had occupied it for the last two years.</p>\n<p>Then, late last month, the Iraqis launched another successful offensive to retake most of the territory north of the peninsula and east of the port city of Basra that the Iranians captured in January, 1987.</p>\n<p>What is still deeply puzzling Western military observers here in the Iraqi capital is that in neither case did the Iranians seem to offer much resistance to the Iraqi attacks. Whatever else they may be, Iranians have proven time and again that they are not cowards.</p>\n<p>‘Easily Gave Up’</p>\n<p>“We find it baffling that the Iranians so easily gave up what it cost them tens of thousand of lives to take only a year and a half ago,” one diplomat said.</p>\n<p>Though some military experts cite a breakdown in Iran’s command structure as a result of political turmoil in Tehran, the major factor behind the Iranian rout appears to be a sudden and severe shortage of manpower.</p>\n<p>There are strong indications that the Iranians had pulled out the bulk of their forces, both from the Faw Peninsula area and from the Shalamcheh area east of Basra, before the Iraqi offensives were launched.</p>\n<p>“The big question,” one military observer said, “is, where is the Iranian army? Suddenly, it seems to have lost its numerical advantage.”</p>\n<p>Iraqi strategists believe their escalation earlier this year of the brutal “War of the Cities,” in which Tehran and other population centers were pounded with more than 170 long-range missiles, has sapped Iranian morale and sharply reduced the numbers of young men volunteering to go to the front.</p>\n<p>Recruitment Problems</p>\n<p>Conventional wisdom once held that the missile attacks only served to harden Iranian resolve, but more recent signs indicate that the Iraqis may have calculated correctly. Iran’s latest recruitment drives have fallen far short of their targets, and one Baghdad-based diplomat, citing figures from a report compiled by his embassy in Tehran, said the number of new recruits was lowest in those areas that had been the most heavily hit by Iraqi missile strikes.</p>\n<p>Whatever the underlying reasons for the decay of Iranian resolve, Iraq has been quick to show that it is capable of taking advantage of the new situation.</p>\n<p>Shackled by a political leadership that regarded its own generals as a greater potential threat than Iran, the Iraqi army has long labored under the burden of a bureaucratic control system requiring Baghdad’s seal of approval for virtually every important field decision.</p>\n<p>This time, however, the generals appear to have convinced President Saddam Hussein that the time was right to strike, and he in turn seems to have given them relatively free rein in planning the attacks at the Faw Peninsula and Shalamcheh, diplomats said. The result was two swift and, for the Iraqis, unusually aggressive assaults that effectively combined their superiority in armor and aircraft with the element of surprise.</p>\n<p>Tenuous Footholds</p>\n<p>Iraqi morale, which hit a low point last year, was dramatically bolstered by the two victories, which left the Iranians with only tenuous footholds in the mountains of northern Kurdistan and in the marshland between the border and Fish Lake, a man-made water barrier east of Basra.</p>\n<p>“Suddenly, they discovered that Iran is not invincible after all,” one diplomat said. “Now they’re taking the offensive and no longer simply waiting behind the trenches for the Iranians to attack.”</p>\n<p>This new-found confidence was articulated by Hussein himself who, in a speech to military commanders last month, said Iraq would stay on the offensive to sap the Iranians of “the motive and morale by which they used to fight.”</p>\n<p>Besides recovering lost territory, Iraqi officials say their aim is to finally force Iran into accepting Resolution 598, the U.N. Security Council’s nearly year-old proposal for a settlement of the war.</p>\n<p>However, diplomats caution that Iran’s recent reversals do not mean it is ready to make peace on the same terms it has rejected in the past.</p>\n<p>Signal for War?</p>\n<p>On the contrary, the appointment Thursday of Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani as the new acting commander of Iran’s armed forces is seen more as a signal that the Iranians plan to continue the war.</p>\n<p>“It suggests they plan to change strategy, not give up, in response to their setbacks,” one Western military expert said, adding he thought that Iran may now give a larger role in the war to its regular armed forces, as opposed to the Revolutionary Guards who have been in charge until now.</p>\n<p>For Iraq’s part, there are signs that it is considering taking the ground war into Iran for the first time in two years.</p>\n<p>Iraqi Defense Minister Adnan Khairallah said after the Shalamcheh victory that the army should not stop at the frontier but should seize Iranian border towns being used as springboards for attacks into Iraq. He mentioned six towns, including Mehran, which Iraqi troops occupied earlier in the war.</p>\n<p>Diplomats here say that Western countries, including the United States, have urged Iraq not to cross the frontier for fear that such an offensive would grossly complicate efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the war.</p>\n<p>However, “this regime is like a pendulum, swinging from one extreme to the other,” one senior diplomat noted.</p>\n<p>The danger now, he said, is that “if Saddam Hussein takes the decision to swing the other way, none of the advisers around him will dare to disagree by counseling caution.”</p> "

It was the first time in more than six weeks that the Iranians have fired one of their long-range missiles at the Iraqi capital.</p>\n<p>Several hours later, Iraqi jet fighters bombed the Iranian shrine city of Qom for the second time in two days in what a military spokesman said was retaliation for the missile attack. Iraqi jets also attacked the cities of Esfahan and Dezful for the second day, scoring “devastating hits,” the spokesman said.</p>\n<p>Basra Hardest Hit</p>\n<p>But it was Basra, Iraq’s second-largest city, about 300 miles southeast of Baghdad, that again came under the heaviest attacks as Iranian missiles and long-range artillery battered the city for the third straight day, killing 22 civilians and injuring 70, Iraqi officials said.</p>\n<p>“Basra is burning,” one resident of the city said in a telephone conversation with a reporter in Baghdad. “From our rooftop, we can see columns of thick smoke billowing up everywhere.”</p>\n<p>Groups of foreign construction workers in Basra were reported to be fleeing the city, and one diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that his embassy was considering organizing a formal evacuation to Baghdad of his country’s nationals.</p>\n<p>58 Killed, 282 Wounded</p>\n<p>The continued shelling of Basra raised the casualty toll in the beleaguered city to 58 people killed and 282 wounded over the last three days. A military communique said an Iranian jet fighter attacked the town of Diyala in central Iraq, hitting a primary school and injuring 48 people, including 34 children.</p>\n<p>(Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, claimed that the Iranian missile fired at Baghdad struck Iraq’s air force command headquarters, a claim denied by an Iraqi spokesman, who said the missile exploded in a residential area.)</p>\n<p>Military spokesmen, meanwhile, said that heavy fighting was continuing east of Basra around an area known as Fish Lake, where the Iranians established a foothold at the start of the latest offensive.</p>\n<p>The spokesmen conceded Tehran’s claims to have sent in reinforcements but said that the fresh Iranian attack was contained on the eastern bank of the long and narrow artificial lake.</p>\n<p>The Iraqis earlier had said that they cleared the Iranians out of positions on the lower tip of the lake’s west bank, about four miles inside Iraqi territory and only six miles due east of Basra, on Saturday.</p>\n<p>While it is impossible to verify these claims from Baghdad, the Iraqi reports suggested that the main Iranian invasion force was now bottled up in an oblong, island-like area, bordered on the west by Fish Lake and on its three other sides by a marshy region that the Iraqis have flooded to create a water barrier extending back to the Iranian frontier.</p>\n<p>Western diplomats in Baghdad agreed that the Iraqis, evidently surprised by the initial assault, now appear to have gained the upper hand in the fighting.</p>\n<p>“As far as I can see, they have the Iranians boxed off, and I doubt the Iranians have much chance of a breakthrough now,” one senior Western diplomat said.</p>\n<p>Still, the Iranians seemed determined to hold on this time and to open a bridgehead for a push towards Basra, and one Western military analyst said he thought that casualties on both sides in the current fighting will prove to be far higher than they were in a similar battle a few miles southeast of Fish Lake last month. Western diplomats here now estimate that about 10,000 Iranians and 2,000 to 3,000 Iraqis were killed in that earlier fighting.</p>\n<p>Claims 11 Divisions Wiped Out</p>\n<p>Since the battle at Fish Lake began, the Iraqis claim to have wiped out 11 divisions of Iranian Revolutionary Guards and four other brigades and to have destroyed or captured 250 tanks and “hundreds” of other vehicles.</p>\n<p>“Iranian losses surpass the imagination,” asserted Maj. Gen. Abdul Jabbar, director general of the Iraqi Defense Ministry’s political department.</p>\n<p>(Iran’s official IRNA news agency, monitored in Cyprus, said that 1,000 Iraqis were killed Sunday in combat with Iranian troops just inside southern Iraq, about 17 miles southeast of Basra. Tehran radio claimed that Iranian forces have killed or wounded 15,000 Iraqi soldiers and captured 1,000 since the offensive began late Thursday.)</p>\n<p>While the Iraqis have not detailed their own casualties, war communiques suggested losses heavier than those admitted to in last month’s fighting.</p>\n<p>One communique conceded that two Iraqi warplanes were shot down over the battlefront Sunday, raising the number of planes Iraq has admitted to losing over the past three days to four.</p> "

    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">BAGHDAD, Iraq — </span> <p>From the moment a visitor touches down at Saddam International Airport, there’s no mistaking whose town this is.</p>\n<p>“Welcome to Baghdad,” says a large sign, “the capital of the Arabs’ Saddam.”</p>\n<p>Saddam, of course, is Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. If one were to list his faults, being camera shy would not be one of them.</p>\n<p>Hussein’s cleft chin and jowly cheeks are seen virtually everywhere in Iraq--on buildings, around intersections, outside towns and alongside roadways. He appears in photographs and paintings, on billboards and murals.</p>\n<p>There are pictures of Hussein the statesman, Hussein the general and Hussein the desert chieftain. In an effort to suggest that he is all things to all Iraqis, there is even Hussein the scholar, wearing doctoral robes outside Baghdad University and Hussein the farmer, swinging a scythe at the Agricultural Workers Federation.</p>\n<p>The pictures are but one manifestation of a personality cult so pervasive and all-embracing as to be without parallel in the Arab world. Not even Libya’s Moammar Kadafi or Tunisia’s Habib Bourguiba, who also have set themselves up as larger-than-life figures in their respective countries, outdo Hussein in this respect.</p>\n<p>On television, musical groups sing songs about Hussein and poets recite odes dedicated to him. Over at the April 28th Shopping Center--April 28 is Hussein’s birthday--a window display features oriental rugs with the Iraqi leader’s face woven into the design.</p>\n<p>Want to see how the ordinary people of Baghdad live? Take a taxi out to Saddam City--that’s right off Saddam Square. Or, if culture is more your thing, check out the new exhibition of portraits at the Saddam Art Gallery.</p>\n<p>No need to guess who the portraits are of.</p>\n<p>Passers-by still do double takes, and with good reason. Not far from the sprawling Ministry of Information is one of Baghdad’s most unusual sites--a building flying the Iranian flag.</p>\n<p>Although they have been at war with one another for more than six years, Iran and Iraq still have diplomatic relations and each maintains an embassy in the other’s capital.</p>\n<p>Entrance to the walled-off and heavily guarded Iranian Embassy is barred to those without special Iraqi government permission, and the three Iranians inside rarely venture out and won’t talk to reporters on the phone.</p>\n<p>“Once a week, they emerge in a guarded convoy to do their shopping, but otherwise nobody sees them,” a Western diplomat said.</p>\n<p>Wisam Zahawie, Iraq’s deputy foreign minister, said the two sides have virtually no official contacts except for when Iraq has reason to believe that its embassy in Tehran is threatened. “Then we call in their man here and warn him,” Zahawie said.</p>\n<p>Given the bitter mutual hatreds that have built up during the course of the long and bloody Persian Gulf War, diplomats in Baghdad still find it “very strange,” in one’s words, that formal relations exist at all.</p>\n<p>However, Zahawie notes that Egypt and Iraq have “close and cooperative” relations without formal diplomatic ties. That Iran and Iraq should have formal relations, even if they have nothing to talk about, “just goes to show that diplomatic relations have come not to mean much any more,” he adds with a shrug.</p>\n<p>Every story of this sort is supposed to contain a quote from a taxi driver and this one is no exception. Herewith the proverbial taxi driver quote:</p>\n<p>“Americans very good. Americans the best. Better than the French, English and Russians,” one Baghdad cabbie really said.</p>\n<p>“Lin-co-lin. Abraham Lin-co-lin and Kennedy very good. But Reagan no good. Reagan cra-zy,” he added, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>The cabbie said he could not understand why President Reagan had authorized the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran. His passenger responded that he was not the only one mystified by that decision.</p>\n<p>Western reporters are not often admitted to Iraq and when they are, they often find it a tough place in which to work. In the past, for instance, a trip to the battlefront meant waiting around for days in a hotel far from the scene of any actual fighting. Sometimes a press conference would be held. Sometimes it wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>However, when Iraqi officials offered to take foreign reporters to the southern front over New Year’s, it was apparent that a decision had been taken to be more open and cooperative. “You can go anywhere you want and see whatever you want,” one official said.</p>\n<p>The reporters were taken to the front all right, but there were still problems with the new open information policy, as illustrated by the following conversation, printed verbatim, between a journalist and a general:</p>\n<p>General: I know you don’t believe we killed 30,000 Iranians, but we will show you the bodies to prove it. You can go to see them now, if you want.</p>\n<p>Journalist: Thank you very much. Now would be fine.</p>\n<p>General: Now? Ah, now it is late. Tomorrow would be better. Now or tomorrow?</p>\n<p>Journalist: Now.</p>\n<p>General: It is very far from here. Better to go tomorrow, OK?</p>\n<p>Journalist: But I have to write a story tonight. Now would be better for me.</p>\n<p>General: Good, we go tomorrow.</p>\n<p>The next day, reporters were taken to a field where they were shown freshly plowed ground.</p>\n<p>“Here is where the bodies are buried,” said an escort officer. “If you had asked to come yesterday you would have seen them. But here are the very shovels we used to bury them, so you know we are telling the truth. You have seen it with your own eyes.”</p> "

    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">UMM AL RASAS, Iraq — </span> <p>From the slits in their cement and sandbag bunkers on the eastern side of this marshy island, Iraqi troops peer out across the Shatt al Arab waterway towards the Iranian lines at Khorramshahr, a scant 300 yards away.</p>\n<p>Everything on the other side appears deserted. But through binoculars, a figure can be seen darting swiftly behind a wall of sandbags that fringe the shore of the shell-shattered and now destroyed and unusable Iranian oil port.</p>\n<p>It was across this narrow strip of water, its shimmering surface pierced here and there by the rusted superstructure of a sunken oil tanker, that thousands of Iranian Revolutionary Guards launched a Christmas Eve offensive, briefly capturing most of Umm al Rasas and three other islands and gaining the Iraqi western bank of the Shatt al Arab at several points.</p>\n<p>The Iraqis, in a fierce counteroffensive that relied heavily on superior firepower, recaptured all of the overrun positions the following day and repelled the invaders.</p>\n<p>Portraying the successful defense of the western bank and the islands as a “decisive victory” in the six-year-old Persian Gulf War, the Iraqis asserted that they killed more than 30,000 Iranian soldiers and captured hundreds more, while suffering only several scores of casualties on their side.</p>\n<p>“You may not believe it, but it is the truth. Our casualties were in the tens--many tens, but only tens,” said Lt. Gen. Maher Abdul Rashid, commander of the Iraqi 7th Corps headquartered near the southern port of Basra. “But the enemy’s casualties were in the thousands, the many thousands.</p>\n<p>“In all the battles I have witnessed, I have never seen such casualties,” he continued. “You do not believe it, but the ones who believe it are the Iranian mothers . . . whose sons’ fate was to become food for the fishes.”</p>\n<p>Western military analysts in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, tend to discount Iraq’s claims of a major victory with thousands of Iranian war dead as an exaggeration intended to boost morale and polish the tarnished image of the Iraqi army both at home and abroad.</p>\n<p>The figure of more than 30,000 Iranian war dead “is absolutely ridiculous,” one Western military expert said. “Knock off at least one zero and maybe two.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it was clear from a two-day tour of the southern war front that the fighting, if brief, had been fierce.</p>\n<p>Craters, Shell Casings</p>\n<p>Everywhere the reporters were taken, they saw the litter of battle--bomb craters and spent shell casings, huts and bunkers scarred by shrapnel and groves of palm trees whose scorched, blackened trunks had been snapped in two like twigs by the force of explosions.</p>\n<p>At a makeshift POW camp at Abu al Khasib, a mile or two from the front, the reporters were shown about 200 Iranian prisoners captured in the attack, along with piles of Chinese- and Soviet-made weapons. There was also other gear used in the crossing, such as life jackets and wet suits made in the United States, Britain and Italy. One reporter, sifting through a pile of captured field radios, found one with Hebrew letters stenciled on it.</p>\n<p>The prisoners, many shaking from fear and shock in the cold morning air, were ordered to kneel on a concrete roadway while the reporters photographed them.</p>\n<p>Most were barefoot and many were bandaged. Some grimaced and moaned in pain, some held their heads in their hands to hide their expressions while others just stared, eyes wide and blank, at nothing.</p>\n<p>Wound Brings Tears</p>\n<p>One young prisoner, with a leg wound still bleeding through its fresh bandage, was carried to join the others by an Iraqi soldier. Before he was set down, his injured leg brushed the shoulder of another kneeling prisoner and he screamed out in pain. The Iraqi laid him quickly on the ground, where he pressed his face to the cold concrete and started to cry. Iraqi officers said the prisoners ranged in age from 15 to 56.</p>\n<p>The tour itself was a rare event, because the Iraqis seldom take Western reporters to their front lines. However, having scored a clear if less than epochal victory over the Iranians, the Iraqis seemed determined to make the most of it for propaganda purposes.</p>\n<p>And for Iraq, the victory came none too soon. After several years of stalemate, the balance of the war appeared to shift in Iran’s favor when Iranian troops crossed the Shatt al Arab and captured the Iraqi town of Al Faw at the mouth of the Persian Gulf in February.</p>\n<p>The Iraqis tried but failed to take it back. In retaliation, they seized the Iranian border town of Mehran on the central war front in May, but could not hold onto it and retreated with heavy losses before an Iranian counterattack in early July.</p>\n<p>Assessments Changed</p>\n<p>Until this year, most military analysts in the West believed that the war was virtually unwinnable by either side, since Iraq’s 5-to-1 advantage in aircraft and armor more or less neutralized Iran’s 3-to-1 advantage in manpower and its willingness to suffer enormous casualties in so-called “human wave” offensives.</p>\n<p>However, after the Iraqi setbacks on the Faw Peninsula and Mehran, some Western military analysts began to rethink their assessments and to shift to the opinion that Iran might actually win the war that has become the longest-running conventional conflict this century.</p>\n<p>That perception was damaging not only to Iraqi morale but to the substantial financial and political support that Iraq receives from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other gulf countries that fear that an Iranian victory might speed the spread of Islamic fundamentalism and lead to the destabilization of their own regimes.</p>\n<p>Lately, however, there have been signs that these countries may be trying to balance their horror at the prospect of an Iranian victory with the pragmatic need to come to terms with Tehran should it win the war. Reports of an extensive Saudi role in the covert sale of U.S. arms to Iran and recent Saudi and Kuwaiti attempts to appease Iran on the question of oil pricing and production by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have been cited by analysts as examples of this shift.</p>\n<p>Iraq Needed a Success</p>\n<p>“After its ignominious failures at Faw and Mehran, Iraq badly needed a military success both for domestic consumption and for its backers in Jordan and the gulf,” a Western diplomat in Baghdad said.</p>\n<p>“We have broken the enemy’s backbone in this battle,” declared Maj. Gen. Talea al Douri, commander of the 3rd Army Corps which, together with the 7th Corps, is responsible for the defense of the southern front.</p>\n<p>“What Iran has been planning for 10 months, we finished in 14 hours. Their casualties were unbelievable. Iran has now lost its well-trained Revolutionary Guards,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite such grandiose assertions, Western diplomats--and privately, a number of senior Iraqi army officers interviewed at or near the front--indicated that they do not think the Iranian attempt to cross the Shatt al Arab was the abortive start of the so-called “final offensive” Iran has long been threatening to launch.</p>\n<p>Iranian Troops Massed</p>\n<p>Noting that the Iranians have an estimated 650,000 troops massed on their side of the border, Western military analysts said the latest fighting appeared to involve no more than about 30,000 troops on both sides.</p>\n<p>While insisting that much larger numbers were involved, senior Iraqi commanders conceded that the Iranian attack was aimed at achieving the more limited but nonetheless critical objective of capturing the islands and gaining a bridgehead on the west bank of the Shatt al Arab in preparation for an assault on Basra, Iraq’s second largest city.</p>\n<p>Only 10 miles from the front, Basra bears the scars of years of periodic Iranian shelling. Here and there, buildings lie in cratered ruins while sandbags line nearly every street, protecting doorways and shop windows against the blast of explosions.</p>\n<p>‘We Were Ready for Them’</p>\n<p>“The enemy’s goal was Basra,” said Gen. Douri. “But we knew this and were ready for them.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Basra’s defenses are formidable. Several hundred thousand Iraqi troops are believed to be in the area, and a giant earthen wall studded with tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery positions stands between the city and the front-line defenses along the Shatt al Arab.</p>\n<p>Were the Iranians to succeed in capturing Basra, they would sever Iraq’s overland link to neighboring Kuwait, heightening the fears of the jittery gulf states. Western analysts believe such an achievement could also prove deeply destabilizing to the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose overthrow Iran has made the main condition for ending the long and bloody war.</p>\n<p>Expects New Attack</p>\n<p>Western analysts and Iraqi military strategists agree that if and when Iran does launch its “final offensive,” Basra will be its initial strategic objective. Thus the Iraqi determination to defend it at any cost.</p>\n<p>Gen. Rashid, the 7th Corps commander whose forces defended Umm al Rasas, said he does not think that the failure of the latest attack will deter the Iranians from trying again. “We expect them to attack at any time,” he said, “but we are ready for them.”</p>\n<p>A New Year’s Day tour of Umm al Rasas and other front-line positions, however, suggested that the Iraqis did not expect another attack to be imminent.</p>\n<p>Long lines of weary troops were packing up their bedrolls and being pulled back from the front, while others were washing socks, cooking meals or lounging outside their bunkers, seemingly oblivious to the sporadic artillery and mortar exchanges whizzing overhead. Most of the fire was outgoing, but now and then an Iranian shell would land with a loud thud and a puff of black smoke. On two occasions, the shells landed within a few hundred yards of the reporters, but the Iraqi soldiers around them seemed unconcerned. Their morale appeared to be high and they flashed victory signs and broke into war dances whenever they saw a television camera being pointed at them.</p>\n<p>“Death to the invaders!” one soldier shouted. “And happy new year to you,” he added with a grin.</p> "

    "title": "Coup Attempt, Military Purge Reported in Iraq : As Many as 200 Executed After Move Against President Hussein in January, Dissidents Assert",
    "date": "February 8, 1989",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">CAIRO — </span> <p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently survived an attempted coup for which a number of senior army officers have been executed, according to diplomats, Iraqi dissidents and intelligence sources.</p>\n<p>Details of the attempted coup are sketchy and, in several instances, contradictory. Kurdish rebel spokesmen and other Iraqi dissident sources have said that as many as 200 army officers and civilians from the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party have been executed over the last two months.</p>\n<p>A senior Arab intelligence official who monitors Iraq closely said the coup attempt occurred around the beginning of January and involved officers from military units “stationed in northern Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Three of Iraq’s seven army corps are stationed in the north--the 5th Army Corps, which is deployed along the border with Turkey; the 1st Special Corps, east of Mosul, and the 2nd Corps, around Sulaymaniyah. Both the 1st and the 2nd Corps were involved in Iraq’s recent campaign against Kurdish separatists, which achieved international notoriety both for its scorched-earth brutality and its reported use of chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>Some reports circulating in both diplomatic and intelligence circles have indicated that officers from the elite Republican Guards--which is charged with protecting the president--were also involved in the attempted coup. If true, this would indicate that the attempt may have constituted a more serious threat to Hussein’s regime than previous attempts by army units or dissident groups to overthrow or assassinate him.</p>\n<p>‘Very Serious Indeed’</p>\n<p>“The Republican Guards are the forces that are supposed to protect Saddam from the rest of the army, so if they were involved, it would be very serious indeed,” one Iraq specialist said.</p>\n<p>In Damascus, where several Syrian and Iranian-supported Iraqi dissident groups are meeting to try to form a united opposition front, members of Massoud Barzani’s Kurdish Democratic Party last week released a list of dozens of senior military and civilian officials who they said were killed in a wave of executions since Dec. 20. The list included a brigadier general described by the Kurdish sources as a divisional commander of the Republican Guards.</p>\n<p>However, a check of the name provided by the Kurdish sources--Brig. Gen. Abdel Ghani Shaneen--failed to confirm either his identity or position. The date they gave for the start of the executions--Dec. 20--also conflicted with other accounts, which indicated that the coup attempt occurred at the beginning of January.</p>\n<p>Part of Postwar Purge</p>\n<p>A possible explanation for this discrepancy, according to one analyst who monitors events in Iraq, could be that the executions began first, as part of a postwar purge of the armed forces, and that this in turn triggered an attempt by some of the northern military units to move against Hussein.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has long suspected that there was a lot of dissent within the army but that it was being held in check by the war (with Iran),” one diplomat familiar with Iraq said. “The question always was what would happen after the war.</p>\n<p>“Knowing about the discontent, Saddam may have moved against potential rivals and malcontents first,” the diplomat added. “Anyone familiar with Iraq knows that if Saddam even suspects someone of dissent, then that dissenter is a goner.”</p>\n<p>Whatever the explanation, the coup attempt itself appears to have been short-lived and easily suppressed, according to diplomats and other sources.</p>\n<p>The senior Arab intelligence official, although supporting the reports of executions, said the figure of 200 cited by dissident sources is almost certainly exaggerated.</p>\n<p>The source said there have been some executions but that, according to preliminary intelligence reports, the number of officers arrested and shot in the aftermath of the attempted coup number “only seven or eight,” all generals or colonels.</p>\n<p>Army Day Canceled</p>\n<p>Army Day, which is celebrated every Jan. 6, was canceled this year without explanation. But apart from that--and the fact that Baghdad is abuzz with rumors of the attempted coup--there have been no outward signs of trouble. “Saddam seems to have contained this. His power is not threatened,” the Arab intelligence source said.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the evidence of unrest within the armed forces nevertheless comes at a politically difficult time for Hussein, diplomats and other analysts agree. As the victor in the Persian Gulf War, his position cannot be described as weak. But Hussein still faces what the analyst said is a difficult time as he seeks to rehabilitate Iraq’s heavily indebted economy after nearly eight years of war.</p>\n<p>The war built up a $70-billion debt and took the lives of more than 160,000 Iraqis, by official count. While there is enormous relief that it is over, the equally enormous task of reconstruction is already said to have run into snags.</p>\n<p>Easing Price Controls</p>\n<p>To deal with the war debt, the Baghdad regime is trying to shrug off its socialist constraints through the easing of price controls and the privatization of a number of state-run industries, especially those in the agricultural and service sectors. However, Iraqis long-used to being cowed by their regime have been slow to respond, and privatization so far has resulted only in soaring inflation.</p>\n<p>Unemployment is also expected to rise as soldiers are demobilized. During the years that the men were away at the front, women moved into the work force in such large numbers that Iraqi officials often stressed to Western visitors how emancipated their country was on women’s rights, compared to other Muslim nations. Now, however, Iraq faces a dilemma of either forcing these women to return to their homes or of finding jobs for a suddenly enlarged work force, diplomats said. Either choice, they added, is likely to generate discontent.</p>\n<p>On top of this, Hussein, a civilian who has no natural power base within the armed forces, must also face the question of “what to do with one of the world’s largest and battle-hardened armies now that the war is over,” a Western military analyst said. “The military has always represented the only viable threat to Hussein’s regime, and controlling that threat has always been his greatest challenge.”</p> "

    "title": "Buchanan Turns to Quotas, Morality for Push in South",
    "date": "February 28, 1992",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">ATLANTA — </span> <p>A funny thing happened to the “Buchanan Brigades” on their way to Atlanta: They stopped being Minutemen and became Confederates.</p>\n<p>Slow to catch fire in the South, Patrick J. Buchanan’s bid to wrest the Republican presidential nomination from George Bush seems to be hitting its stride as the conservative commentator reworks both the issues and the metaphors he uses to convey them to his new audience of Southerners.</p>\n<p>When he arrived in Georgia last week, Buchanan was still focused on the economic anxieties that served him so well in New Hampshire, where he evoked images of the Revolutionary War to describe his rebellion against “King George.” But what helped propel him to a surprisingly strong finish in the New Hampshire primary failed to resonate as deeply in the South, where the impact of the recession has been milder. “It didn’t click,” one campaign adviser conceded.</p>\n<p>So now, after visits to four other Southern states in the last week, Buchanan is back in Georgia, seeking to exploit more regional forms of conservative dissatisfaction with messages attacking racial quotas, homosexual art and, as he put it in one speech, Republican “Yankee wimps” in Washington.</p>\n<p>Typifying his new approach is a TV ad his campaign unveiled Wednesday that features scenes from a PBS documentary in which gay black men are in various stages of undress. The ad blasts Bush for allowing federal funding of the program and other forms “of so-called art.”</p>\n<p>Continuing his new focus on social issues, Buchanan called AIDS “nature’s form of retribution” against homosexuals during a radio talk show.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, he paid a highly publicized visit to a family grave site in Mississippi, where a great grandfather who owned slaves and fought for the Confederacy is buried.</p>\n<p>Pat Buchanan has discovered his Southern roots, and they are not the same as Alex Haley’s.</p>\n<p>“In New Hampshire, the economy was the only thing voters were interested in,” the Buchanan adviser said. “In the South, the quota issue and the emphasis on traditional morality clearly go over better.”</p>\n<p>Buchanan’s current strategy is straightforward: He wants the South to rise again by supporting him against Bush in Tuesday’s Georgia primary. And he is hoping a strong showing will serve as a springboard for the Super Tuesday primaries on March 10, when voters in seven Southern or border states go to the polls.</p>\n<p>“A lot of voters in other states are going to be looking to Georgia to see how well Buchanan does here. For both Bush and Buchanan, Georgia is the jumping-off point for the South,” said Michael Binford, a Georgia State University political science professor.</p>\n<p>Buchanan himself has concluded that Georgia is “the New Hampshire of the South” and holds the key to the rest of his campaign.</p>\n<p>Buchanan spokesman Greg Mueller said: “New Hampshire was like a giant wave that got us this far. Now that wave is cresting and we have to find a new one to ride into Super Tuesday. And the place to find it is in Georgia.”</p>\n<p>Thus, after padding somewhat aimlessly around the South--the campaign has been in Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana the last week--Buchanan is back in Georgia, devoting all his time and resources to the state between now and Tuesday’s primary.</p>\n<p>Can the Buchanan campaign catch the perfect wave in Georgia?</p>\n<p>Most experts say a Buchanan victory is doubtful, if only because the Republican Establishment firmly backs Bush and because the working-class vote that Buchanan is trying to attract historically has failed to turn out in large numbers for primaries. Buchanan is hindered from mobilizing that vote by his lack of a strong organizational structure.</p>\n<p>But Buchanan is expected to benefit from Georgia election laws that allow voters from any party to vote in the primary of their choice. Thus, middle-class Democrats who are traditionally conservative have the option of supporting Buchanan.</p>\n<p>“The crossover vote is the real wild card in Georgia that makes everything hard to predict,” said Michael Giles, an expert on state politics at Atlanta’s Emory University.</p>\n<p>Between now and Tuesday, Buchanan plans to crisscross the state on daily bus tours, hammering home his protectionist “America first” theme and attacking what have emerged as his two favorite targets in his Southern campaign: the 1991 Civil Rights Act and the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>\n<p>In several speeches, Buchanan has described the civil rights bill that Bush signed last year after protracted negotiations with Congress as an “outrage” that will force businesses to adopt hiring quotas to avoid being sued by minorities alleging racial discrimination. He has been careful to emphasize that he believes blacks and other minorities have the same rights as whites, but he suggests that the federal government now discriminates against whites.</p>\n<p>“Reverse discrimination moves America in the wrong direction. We’ve got to get back to the test of excellence and merit. . . . The most qualified man or woman should get the job,” Buchanan says.</p>\n<p>The NEA is the target in the Buchanan ad featuring the gay blacks; the documentary that included them was funded by the agency. Referring to that program and other controversial funding decisions by the NEA, the ad says: “The Bush Administration has invested our tax dollars in pornographic and blasphemous art . . . (that) has glorified homosexuals, exploited children and perverted the image of Jesus Christ.”</p>\n<p>Bush, who was attending a seven-nation drug summit Thursday in San Antonio, studiously declined comment on the ad, at least for now. “Not today,” Bush said, when asked for a reaction.</p>\n<p>White House Chief of Staff Samuel K. Skinner, during a stop in Chicago, said such commercials “don’t belong in a presidential campaign” and predicted the people of Georgia would reject them.</p>\n<p>Buchanan, however, did not hesitate to elaborate on the ad’s theme, saying Thursday that, if elected, he would “shut down, padlock and fumigate” the NEA.</p>\n<p>And still another new Buchanan ad criticizes the Administration for a proposal--since abandoned--that would have required churches to divulge to the federal government the names of major donors.</p>\n<p>As Buchanan’s campaign turned increasingly aggressive, the honorary chairman of Bush’s Georgia campaign, Republican Rep.

    "title": "Border Defeat Casts Doubt on Iran’s War Effort : Iraqis Report ‘Fierce Battle’ Near Basra but Indicate Foe ‘Had All Run Away’",
    "date": "May 30, 1988",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">SHALAMCHEH, Iraq — </span> <p>“We Are Men of War,” reads the large hand-painted sign written in Persian, the language of Iran. “Do Not Imagine You Can Defeat Us.”</p>\n<p>Along with several abandoned crates of unused ammunition, the newly painted sign was the only evidence of 17 months of Iranian occupation encountered by the Iraqi troops who recaptured this battered border checkpoint in southern Iraq on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“It was a fierce battle,” said an Iraqi soldier at Shalamcheh. “But by the time we got here, the Iranians had gone. They had all run away.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, all the available evidence pieced together by Western diplomats in Baghdad and by foreign reporters taken on a tour of the Shalamcheh region over the weekend suggests that, despite the bravado of the slogans they left behind, the Iranians withdrew from here without much of a fight.</p>\n<p>Intense Speculation</p>\n<p>This, in turn, has prompted intense speculation about whether Iran’s war effort, strained by serious manpower problems and reeling from a series of recent setbacks, is finally on the brink of collapse.</p>\n<p>“Many people took it for granted that Iran could carry on with this war while continuing to suffer large casualties,” one Baghdad-based diplomat said, citing the Iranians’ revolutionary fervor and their 3-to-1 advantage in population. “But now may be the time to rethink this premise. The Iranians have suffered a lot lately, and they’re starting to show it.”</p>\n<p>A trip to Shalamcheh these days requires a sturdy four-wheel-drive vehicle and a healthy appetite for dust.</p>\n<p>It begins by crossing the Shatt al Arab waterway at a point just north of the southern port of Basra, then turning southeast and driving down across the narrow Jasim River, through mangled groves of shell-blasted date palms and past rings of tank-studded earthen walls until one arrives at what could pass for the End of the World: a surreal and lifeless landscape, choked with coils of barbed wire and littered with spent shell casings.</p>\n<p>Here, in the dry season, the dust is so thick that, even from miles away, a moving jeep leaves a very visible trail for Iranian artillery gunners. From their side of the border, they try to guess the speed and direction and then take aim at the moving clouds left in the vehicle’s wake.</p>\n<p>Every now and then, an incoming shell lands with a dull thud in this cratered, sun-bleached wasteland, sending up a pretty plume of sand and dust. For the most part, however, it is eerily quiet as a small convoy of vehicles bounces almost blindly along the uneven dirt tracks, enveloped in a hazy cocoon of fine yellow sand.</p>\n<p>But once at Shalamcheh, which lies less than two miles west of the border, the visitor finds a curious sight. The Iraqis have brought up a refrigerated truck and, on Friday, were waiting with glasses of ice-cold mineral water for the first Western reporters to reach the battlefront. Other soldiers were rummaging through the bunkers hastily vacated by the Iranians only two days earlier at the end of the nine-hour-long blitzkrieg by troops from Iraq’s 3rd Army and the elite Presidential Guards.</p>\n<p>Yet the oddest thing about Shalamcheh now is that, while it has been pummeled into powder by years of artillery fire--first by Iran and then by Iraq--there is little evidence of the fierce fighting that Iraq says took place there before the Iranians retreated. This pile of rubble, honeycombed with bunkers and cratered by artillery fire, was supposed to have been the strategic prize of Iraq’s most significant victory over Iran in 7 1/2 years of war.</p>\n<p>In reaching Shalamcheh, the Iraqis cleared a narrow corridor of land north of the Shatt al Arab and south of a man-made water barrier known as Fish Lake and relieved the pressure on Basra, 25 miles to the west. That achievement, coming on the heels of Iraq’s successful offensive to recapture the Faw Peninsula last month, finally eliminated the Iranian threat in the south.</p>\n<p>The Iraqis said they routed five divisions of Iranian troops from Shalamcheh and positions around the southeastern end of Fish Lake in their blitz. But while the reporters did see evidence of fighting in places--the bodies of dozens of dead Iranians and the twisted, blackened remains of several tanks--they saw nothing suggesting a major battle, and the tour raised many more questions in the end than it answered. Indeed, Iraqi officers were under strict orders, from what was said to be the political department of the army, to answer no questions at all.</p>\n<p>They were extremely polite, treating the reporters, at 3rd Army headquarters, to a lavish lunch of lamb, grilled meats, fresh vegetables, fruit and vanilla and chocolate pudding for dessert. But they were rigorous in their refusal to answer questions, even seemingly innocuous ones.</p>\n<p>When a senior officer was asked if the fighting had been heavy, he shrugged his shoulders and replied, “I don’t know.” When the soldier at Shalamcheh, apparently unaware of the restrictions, started describing the Iranian rout, he was quickly cut off by the reporters’ escort officer.</p>\n<p>This reticence seemed odd because, on previous battlefront tours, the Iraqis trundled out generals and field commanders for press conferences that became tests of endurance as the officers boasted about their victories at great length. Yet, even if the Iranians failed to fight hard this time, the offensives at Faw and Shalamcheh were genuinely important victories for the Iraqis, victories that may even have turned the tide of the war decisively in Iraq’s favor, diplomats in Baghdad said.</p>\n<p>Further, the diplomats added, the offensives were cleverly planned and well-executed operations that have done much to erase the negative impression that Western military analysts had begun to form of the well-equipped but seemingly gun-shy Iraqi army. “The Iraqi strategy this time was brilliant,” one diplomat said. “They planned well, and they took the Iranians completely by surprise.”</p>\n<p>Thus, one of the questions the diplomats are puzzling over at the moment is why the Iraqis are not boasting now, when they have something genuine to boast about. One possible answer is that, if Faw and Shalamcheh were indeed walkovers, the Iraqis might not want it known because it would tend to diminish the dimensions of the victories they are claiming.</p>\n<p>Even more puzzling is why the Iranians retreated so quickly from their most important foothold in Iraq. “Everything we’ve seen at both Faw and Shalamcheh is completely uncharacteristic of the Iranians,” a Western military analyst said. “They don’t seem to have been taking many casualties there, so their retreat is a real mystery.”</p>\n<p>One line of speculation is that the Iranians, unable to launch a winter offensive after this year’s recruitment drive fell considerably short of its target, had thinned out their forces in the south, diverting them to the northern front in the belief that the Iraqis would not attack in the south.</p>\n<p>“They gambled and lost,” the military analyst said. “At the same time, the Iraqis played it very well. They mounted a good, swift maneuver.”</p>\n<p>“The Iraqis used brilliant tactics,” another diplomat said. “They seem to have fooled the Iranians completely.” He pointed out that, just a few days before the Shalamcheh offensive, the Iraqis moved large numbers of the Presidential Guards from the southern sector to the northern war front, “and rumors were rife around here that the big attack would be up north.</p>\n<p>“They used the same strategy against the Iranians as the Iranians used against them when they attacked Fish Lake last year after a diversionary strike in the central sector,” the diplomat added, noting that, in both cases, “it worked.”</p>\n<p>What the reporters saw on their restricted and carefully controlled tour reinforced the impression that the Iranian occupation force had been taken by surprise. They saw about a dozen blasted tanks and other tracked vehicles, although a few looked like they could have been knocked out in earlier fighting.</p>\n<p>Along one side of a dirt road near the Duayji River, just south of the Jasim, the reporters counted the sun-blackened bodies of 13 Iranians. Just before reaching a small, shell-damaged bridge over the river itself, they saw perhaps another 20 or 30 bodies clustered in several mounds.</p>\n<p>At 3rd Army headquarters, they were shown about 350 Iranian prisoners sitting in ragged rows on an asphalt lot under the hot sun. The POWs were shown to reporters on the condition that no questions be asked. The escort officer said all the prisoners captured in the Shalamcheh offensive were being brought to the army headquarters for identification before being sent to internment camps farther north.</p>\n<p>Most of the prisoners appeared to be in their 20s and 30s, but there were a few who seemed to be not even in their teens, and there was one white-haired man who an Iraqi officer said was 70.</p>\n<p>“Look at them,” the officer said. “They send even their children and their old men to fight us.”</p> "

    "date": "February 21, 1992",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">WASHINGTON — </span> <p>Republican Patrick J. Buchanan, searching for ways to prolong the political life of his presidential campaign beyond New Hampshire, told a major gathering of conservatives here Thursday that it was time for them to “take a stand and choose” between him and President Bush.</p>\n<p>“We have taken our stand and we made our case and fought the good fight,” Buchanan told the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual convention of conservative groups from across the country. “Now it is time for others to take a stand. Buchanan or Bush. It’s a time to choose.”</p>\n<p>Buoyant after his unexpectedly strong showing in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, Buchanan received an enthusiastic response from his audience. As he swept into the convention hall, he upstaged a panel discussion about tax cuts when its participants were suddenly drowned out by applause and rhythmic chants of “Pat, Pat, Pat.”</p>\n<p>Buchanan’s speech, frequently interrupted by applause, was laced with the Revolutionary War rhetoric that he has affected of late to embellish his self-cast role as the Paul Revere of the Republican right.</p>\n<p>“We need a new American Revolution here in the United States,” Buchanan said. “We have to do to George I, the big government Republican, what our forefathers did to George III.”</p>\n<p>Bush, for his part, spent the day working at the White House after returning from a Wednesday campaign visit to Tennessee, one of several key Southern states holding primaries within the next three weeks. The President, chastened by his unexpectedly small 16-point win over Buchanan in New Hampshire, returns to the campaign trail today with a trip to South Carolina.</p>\n<p>Bush aides also mapped out details of a trip next week that begins Tuesday in California and then takes the President to Texas and Georgia. “The President plans to visit as many of the Southern states as he can” before the approaching primaries, said Judy Smith, deputy White House press secretary.</p>\n<p>Buchanan, in his speech, took note of Bush’s pledge after the New Hampshire vote to campaign harder against his challenger.</p>\n<p>Buchanan professed gratitude that Bush, who mostly sought to ignore his rival’s jabs while campaigning in New Hampshire, had “finally remembered my name.” He also said he was eager to debate the President on taxes, jobs, civil rights and foreign policy.</p>\n<p>In a reference to one of the many television talk shows on which he developed his national reputation as a fiery defender of the conservative creed, Buchanan declared, “Welcome to Crossfire, Mr. President.”</p>\n<p>Addressing issues other than the President, Buchanan said that he was against “Japan-bashing” but that he was “sick and tired of gratuitous slurs” by its officials about the work ethic in America. And he drew loud applause when he referred to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as “Mr. Dung.”</p>\n<p>David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, predicted that, although the lion’s share of those now backing Buchanan will end up supporting Bush, they are hoping that his challenger’s campaign will “send a wake-up call to Bush to get his message and his act together” before the fall election.</p>\n<p>Times staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this story.</p> "

    "date": "January 4, 1987",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">BASRA, Iraq — </span> <p>The Luay nightclub was packed to capacity on New Year’s Eve. A morose-looking band played Arabic music while a swarthy belly dancer performed on a small stage to the enthusiastic cheers of the all-male audience.</p>\n<p>No one seemed to mind that the dancer, attired in a black-and-silver, sequin-studded gown, looked something like the Michelin Man in drag. Good nightclub talent is scarce in the seventh year of Iraq’s war with Iran.</p>\n<p>Besides, the people of Basra had something special to celebrate this New Year’s Eve. Only a week earlier and barely 10 miles away, the Iraqi army had repelled an attempt by the Iranians to storm across the Shatt al Arab waterway and gain a foothold in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Closest to Front Lines</p>\n<p>Basra is Iraq’s second-largest city, with a population of about 1 million. Situated on the southeastern tip of Iraq, only minutes by car from the frontier with Iran, it is the closest major Iraqi population center to the front lines.</p>\n<p>Apart from an occasional missile attack, Baghdad, the Iraqi capital 300 miles northwest of Basra, has been largely insulated from the rigors of war. But here in this seaport on the Shatt al Arab, famed as the place from which Sinbad the Sailor set forth on his journeys in “The Arabian Nights,” the war is a fact of life.</p>\n<p>Periodic Iranian artillery attacks over the years have left their mark. Here and there, rows of neat white houses are broken by gaping holes--resembling from afar a child’s smile with a few front teeth missing.</p>\n<p>Sandbags Line Walls</p>\n<p>Sandbag walls line nearly every street, shielding shop windows and entrances from shrapnel. On New Year’s Eve, several shells landed in a residential area of Basra, killing one person and setting a house on fire, according to a military communique.</p>\n<p>Iraqi strategists believe that Iran’s most pressing military objective now is to capture Basra, for its fall would be a devastating blow to the Iraqi war effort. If the city of Sinbad should ever fall to Iran, with it would go Iraq’s only outlet to the sea and its one overland link to neighboring Kuwait and the rest of the Persian Gulf.</p>\n<p>For months now, Iran has been threatening to launch a so-called “final offensive” aimed at achieving its declared objective of overthrowing the Iraqi regime of President Saddam Hussein and securing “total victory” in the long gulf war.</p>\n<p>No ‘Final Offensive’ Yet</p>\n<p>But despite a massive mobilization of troops--Western analysts believe the Iranians now have more than 700,000 soldiers poised along the 730-mile-long frontier--the final offensive has failed to materialize, and a growing number of military analysts are beginning to doubt that it will. For while Iran has a clear advantage over Iraq in terms of manpower--its population of 45 million is three times greater than Iraq’s--the Iranians have neither the heavy weaponry nor the logistical aptitude to sustain a major, full-scale offensive, the analysts say.</p>\n<p>So the betting now is that Iran will focus its efforts on Basra in hopes of severing Iraq’s strategic southeastern tip from the rest of the country. While the Iraqi government is dominated by Muslims from the minority Sunni sect, the southeast is populated mostly by Shia Muslims, the same sect that rules in Iran. Thus if the Iranians were to capture Basra, one scenario holds that they would set up a Shia mini-state there and use it as a base from which to spread the Iranian revolution north into the rest of Iraq and south into the gulf states.</p>\n<p>Even if that did not happen--and there is considerable evidence to suggest that Iraq’s majority Shias care no more for Iranian fundamentalism than its Sunnis do--the loss of Basra would have a devastating impact on the morale and perhaps the political stability of the Iraqi regime, analysts say.</p>\n<p>Formidable Defenses</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, then, Basra’s defenses are formidable. The bleak and sandy terrain around the city has been transformed by bulldozers into a moonscape of grotesque mounds and horseshoe-shaped walls that serve as tank, artillery and missile emplacements. Fields of barbed wire and a long earthen wall dotted with tanks guard the southern approaches to the city, while the Iraqis have flooded the marshes that lie above Basra to prevent the Iranians from descending on the city from the northwest.</p>\n<p>Still, when the Iranians stormed across the mouth of the Shatt al Arab and seized the Iraqi oil terminal of Faw last February, it gave the populace of Basra a collective case of the jitters. The collapse of Faw, about 70 miles southeast of Basra on the Persian Gulf, gave the Iranians a foothold on the Iraqi side of the Shatt al Arab and made the people of Basra feel that much more hemmed in.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the Iraqi army’s victory in the recent fighting east and southeast of Basra was a much needed boost to morale. Hoping to widen their foothold in Iraqi territory, the Iranians struck at three points along a 20-mile front but were driven back with heavy casualties after a night and a day of fighting.</p>\n<p>Primed for Good Time</p>\n<p>Thus, periodic shelling or no, people were primed for a good time in the Luay nightclub and dozens of other steamy establishments like it in Basra on New Year’s Eve.</p>\n<p>Tough-looking young men crowded around the tables, swilling beer and whiskey sold by the bottle, clapping their hands to the music and filling the air with so much cigarette smoke that the giant “No Smoking” sign at one end of the room was hardly visible. A bevy of Iraqi “hostesses” stood in formidable formation around the bar, drawing lascivious glances from knots of off-duty soldiers.</p>\n<p>A moment before midnight, the houselights were doused and the countdown to 1987 began. When the lights blazed on again, the men leaped from their chairs and jumped onto the stage, from which the belly dancer thought it wise to retreat as everyone shouted and danced and waved their arms in wild abandon. For a few minutes at least, the war was forgotten and everyone in this sad and battle-scarred city had a good time.</p> "

    "title": "Iranians Launch Wave of Attacks Near Basra : Iraqis Report Thousands Driven Back in Heavy Fighting; Analysts Disagree on Progress of War",
    "date": "January 20, 1987",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">BAGHDAD, Iraq — </span> <p>The Iraqi military reported Monday that thousands of Iranian troops launched a new wave of attacks near the beleaguered port city of Basra overnight but were driven back in heavy fighting.</p>\n<p>Intelligence estimates of the latest fighting on the southern front of the Persian Gulf War varied widely, with some Washington officials minimizing Iran’s recent gains and some military analysts here in the Iraqi capital suggesting that the latest Iranian assault represents a serious threat to Iraq.</p>\n<p>Iran reported that its invasion force had broken through Iraqi defenses and was driving toward Basra, Iraq’s second-largest city. The official Iranian news agency added that the capture of four more islands in the Shatt al Arab waterway was “imminent.”</p>\n<p>Iraq, however, asserted that its troops had the Iranians bottled up in marshland east of Basra. And it reported “destructive raids” by its air force on six cities in Iran, the 11th day its warplanes had bombed enemy cities.</p>\n<p>An Iraqi war communique said that “an estimated eight divisions” of paramilitary Iranian Revolutionary Guards launched human-wave attacks on Iraqi lines southeast of Basra in an attempt to expand the bridgehead they have established east and south of the city. “A fierce battle took place” in which Iraqi forces “gallantly wiped out recurring enemy waves and stood fast in their positions,” the communique said.</p>\n<p>Bridgehead Widened</p>\n<p>The communique offered no other details of the latest fighting in the south, which erupted 11 days ago when the Iranians succeeded in crossing a large water barrier about six miles due east of Basra to establish a bridgehead behind man-made Fish Lake. Since then, the Iranians appear to have widened their bridgehead southward to the Shatt al Arab waterway, where they claimed to have captured three small islands and are said now to besieging a fourth, called Umm al Rassas. A few miles southeast of Fish Lake, Umm al Rassas was the site of an abortive Iranian offensive over Christmas.</p>\n<p>In Washington, wire services quoted Administration officials as saying the major change in the situation “has been in the tone of the communiques from both sides” and in a more intensive shelling of Basra.</p>\n<p>One official, who has followed the intelligence reports on an hourly basis since the start of the current Iranian offensive, said: “Iran has not made any significant gains. The Iranians have suffered heavy unit losses. The Iranian forces are not moving on Basra from the south.”</p>\n<p>U.S. officials said the current southern offensive is smaller than the Iranian drive against the city of Al Faw in February, 1986, when U.S. intelligence estimated that 60,000 Iranian troops were committed. The estimate for the current campaign is, according to one U.S. official, “35,000 Iranian troops, plus or minus 10,000.”</p>\n<p>One U.S. official said the fighting, although sporadically intense, appears to be more a “war of communiques” than a major offensive. The U.S. intelligence reports also caution that the situation remains unpredictable and suggest that the fighting could reach a larger scale.</p>\n<p>Difference of Opinion</p>\n<p>Here in Baghdad, there was considerable difference of opinion as to the war outlook. Western military observers, while agreeing that the Iranians may not actually be about to capture Basra, said the invaders have significantly consolidated their position east of the city.</p>\n<p>One analyst said that the Iranians--who have shelled the eastern outskirts of Basra for some time--now have enlarged their area of bombardment and are shelling the western reaches of the city. This indicates, he said, that they have strengthened their beachhead and brought up heavy guns.</p>\n<p>Even if the invaders fail to capture Basra, said another observer here in Baghdad, they have succeeded in terrorizing the city, causing nearly 600 civilian casualties and forcing the evacuation of most of its population of 1 million--and have established a foothold in the most heavily defended sector of Iraq. If nothing else, he said, this represent a significant psychological victory.</p>\n<p>Island’s Fall Predicted</p>\n<p>Iranian war communiques Monday night claimed that Umm al Rassas was on the verge of falling. Iraqi military spokesmen denied this but indirectly confirmed that the Iranians were attacking the island by saying that the Iraqi army’s 7th Corps was now also engaged in heavy fighting along with the 3rd Corps. The 3rd Corps is responsible for defending the area east and northeast of Basra, including Fish Lake, while the 7th Corps holds the area south and southeast of the city, including Umm al Rassas and several other islands in the Shatt al Arab.</p>\n<p>Basra itself came under more Iranian artillery fire Monday, which killed one person and injured seven others, an Iraqi military spokesman said.</p>\n<p>In the air war, Iraq said its warplanes again raided the Iranian towns of Dezful, Tabriz, Esfahan, Qom and Kermanshah, “reducing their targets to wreckage.”</p>\n<p>Military analysts said the Iraqi air blitz may increase pressure on Iran’s leaders to launch a long-promised “final offensive” for victory in the war, which began in September, 1980.</p>\n<p>Several key figures in Tehran have indicated that the invasion, which began Jan. 9 with Basra as its main target, will continue “until victory.”</p>\n<p>King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, an Iraqi ally, voiced concern Monday over the latest escalation in the war. The king said Saudi Arabia will defend its territory “with all available means” against any spillover from the conflict.</p> "

    "title": "Medicare, Welfare, Budget Dog Politicians on Stump : Politics: After spring break, Democrats claim to see silver lining in public’s mood--loss of support for GOP ‘contract.’ But they themselves face tough sell.",
    "date": "May 8, 1995",
    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">GROTON, Conn. — </span> <p>It was a crisp and clear New England spring morning as Democratic Rep. Sam Gejdenson swerved his mud-spattered Jeep into the parking lot of the Stop &amp; Shop, bounded across the pavement and positioned himself in front of the supermarket’s swing doors.</p>\n<p>“Hello, how are you? I’m Sam Gejdenson,” he told a startled woman emerging from the store with her two children and a load of groceries. “Your congressman,” he added helpfully.</p>\n<p>“Don’t tell me you want my vote again!” the woman exclaimed as she veered her cart sharply out of Gejdenson’s way and headed for the parking lot.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, I’m Sam Gejden-,” he started to tell another shopper.</p>\n<p>“I know who you are,” she interrupted. “And I already have one of your potholders!”</p>\n<p>Such reactions reflect the problems that both sides of the political aisle--but particularly Democrats--face as they try to win voters’ allegiance in the upcoming debates in Washington over Medicare, welfare reform and the budget deficit.</p>\n<p>But if it seems that politicians on the stump are about as unwelcome as panhandlers, Democrats returning to Washington after their spring break claim to see a silver lining in the public’s mood.</p>\n<p>“People have come back from this break realizing the programs the Republicans put forward aren’t sitting well in their districts,” said Rep. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.), the House minority whip. “The Republican plan . . . is losing support, day by day and month by month.”</p>\n<p>Girding for the legislative battles that resume in earnest this week, Democrats like Gejdenson hope to tap into the electorate’s anxiety by portraying themselves as defenders of the middle class--a strategy that they hope will pay off as Republicans begin to specify which programs they will cut to balance the budget by the year 2002.</p>\n<p>“Our counteroffensive is coming in May and June, as they start putting out specific pieces of the budget,” said Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.). “The tide is turning as people realize how the ‘contract with America’ will impact on their lives.”</p>\n<p>But as they plotted strategy for coming months at a retreat over the weekend, the Democrats had to acknowledge that the message from their districts is mixed. For if polls show that voters have not completely bought into the GOP agenda, it is also evident that the Democrats have yet to redeem themselves in the eyes of the electorate.</p>\n<p>Outside the Groton Stop &amp; Shop, some shoppers stopped to compliment Gejdenson or talk about local issues, but two themes recurred: profound mistrust of politics and a deep anxiety about jobs and financial security.</p>\n<p>Groton, New London, Mystic and the other picturesque old towns that dot the eastern shore of Connecticut are not unlike many other areas of the country that have been forced to adjust to changing economic times. But, like parts of Southern California, this area also has been hit by another wrenching change: the end of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Electric Boat, the Groton division of General Dynamics that makes the Navy’s Seawolf submarine, is still the area’s largest employer. But its work force has been halved in recent years to about 12,000 workers. And over the next few years it is expected to lay off 6,000 more as Congress moves to eliminate the Seawolf program.</p>\n<p>While other industries, such as pharmaceuticals and tourism, are picking up, the service jobs that have replaced much of the area’s defense manufacturing base offer neither the security, the esteem nor the high pay that the predominantly blue-collar work force once took for granted.</p>\n<p>“They’re worried about their jobs. They’re ticked off. They’re angry. But they don’t know how to direct it,” a Gejdenson aide said.</p>\n<p>The region is overwhelmingly white and blue-collar. Only 7% of the population is nonwhite. Although they usually pick Republicans in presidential races, the voters have been considered solidly Democratic on the congressional level.</p>\n<p>But despite what business leaders say has been a tireless effort by Gejdenson to save the Seawolf program and protect jobs in the district, last year a Republican state senator, who even GOP insiders admit was a lackluster candidate, came within 21 votes of defeating him. What’s more, the Republican, Edward Munster, was forced to share what was seen as a strongly anti-incumbent vote with an independent candidate closely allied to Ross Perot, who in the second district polled 27% in the presidential race.</p>\n<p>To Republicans, this suggests that Gejdenson, an eight-term liberal whose near-death experience last year earned him the nickname “Landslide Sam,” could be an easy mark next year. “He’s at the top of our target list,” a GOP congressional campaign strategist confirmed.</p>\n<p>Democrats agree that Gejdenson looks vulnerable. But they predict that Democrats will begin to shore up their positions as the budget debate progresses.</p>\n<p>Not all the experts are convinced, however. While they agree that the Republicans may have overstepped their mandate and pushed too far and too fast with many of their reforms, some analysts also believe that Democrats may be drawing the wrong lessons from what they learned in their districts over the spring break.</p>\n<p>“Most voters, right now, still basically think the Republicans are moving in the right direction, but they also think they are going too far. They’re grateful to the Democrats for checking the Republicans but still think they have their heads in the sand,” said Charles Cook, a Washington-based political analyst.</p>\n<p>Many analysts see deeper reasons for the continuing vulnerability of Gejdenson and other Democrats: endemic problems that the party has not yet addressed. Among the problems are President Clinton’s low approval ratings, the popularity of term limits and the cultural--if not precisely ideological--conservatism that seems to be sweeping the country as people trade one kind of insecurity for another in the ambiguity of the post-Cold War world.</p> "

    "text": "  <span class=\"dateline\">BAGHDAD, Iraq — </span> <p>Nobody goes bowling in Baghdad any more.</p>\n<p>“Business very bad,” the attendant concedes at one of the several bowling alleys that have sprung up around town in recent years to cater to the passion that many middle-and upper-class Iraqis have inexplicably developed for the sport.</p>\n<p>“It is the missiles,” he adds gravely, pausing as if to consider the profundity of his next statement. “Missiles very bad for the bowling business.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the government’s determined effort to insulate most Iraqis from the nastier aspects of the war, Baghdad still looks and behaves in many ways like a city that doesn’t seem to realize it is only 85 miles from the front lines of a conflict that has now lasted longer than World War II.</p>\n<p>Life Goes On</p>\n<p>The well-heeled still prowl the discotheques of Baghdad’s five-star hotels on Thursday nights, or go to the races on Fridays. Those with less money and more time to kill can be found crowding the video game parlors downtown, practicing for war by waging imaginary battles against incoming waves of enemy spaceships.</p>\n<p>It all seems a bit unreal, but no more so than the daily drone of communiques that describe to Iraqis the crushing defeats and horrendous casualties their army has inflicted upon the real enemy that day.</p>\n<p>The real enemy, of course, is Iran, with which Iraq has been locked in a war that neither side seems able to win but that Iran, after more than six years, still refuses to end.</p>\n<p>‘The War Without End’</p>\n<p>Indeed, they sometimes call it that here--”the war without end.” In the sleazy video parlors, the smoke-filled tea rooms along Saddoun Street, in shops and restaurants, people shrug their shoulders or shake their heads when asked when they think the war will end.</p>\n<p>“Who knows?” says a cab driver to whom the question is put. “Maybe tomorrow or maybe never. No one knows. Only God. He knows.”</p>\n<p>The government’s policy is to maintain the appearance of normality as far as possible, and Baghdad’s 4 million residents oblige by taking much in their stride and coping as best they can.</p>\n<p>Yet if the war seems only to have scratched the surface of Baghdad in a physical sense, it has cut much deeper in other, more profound ways--emotionally, socially and economically.</p>\n<p>The war has now claimed more than 100,000 Iraqi lives--twice as many servicemen as the United States lost in combat in Vietnam. Although Iranian casualties have been much higher, the loss of so many young men is especially devastating to a small country like Iraq, which has only 14 million people.</p>\n<p>“There is not a family that hasn’t lost a relative in this war, and many families are now losing their second and third members,” a Western diplomat said here. “The Iraqis did really well in developing their country in the past, but now they are losing an entire generation. That’s the killer.”</p>\n<p>The government has contrived an elaborate ruse to cushion the shock of seeing the dead come home. From the southern front near the port of Basra, the bodies are sent to Baghdad by overnight train, then transferred in the cold, gray hours before dawn to trucks that take them to a giant refrigerated warehouse west of the capital.</p>\n<p>Bodies Released Gradually</p>\n<p>Gradually, over a period of weeks, they are released in small batches to their relatives so as to prevent any mass spectacle of grief that might be damaging to morale. Public funerals are banned in Baghdad for the same reason, and there are now restrictions on the number of black banners that people may hang outside their homes to signify the loss of a family member, diplomats say.</p>\n<p>If the government tries to coddle its civilian population, it also goes to considerable lengths to make the war as convenient as possible for its one million soldiers. Troops are given a week’s leave every five weeks and are posted to the front closest to their homes to make visits easier. One of the war’s more incongruous sights is the parking lots near the fronts where soldiers leave their cars.</p>\n<p>Still, after all this time, the veneer of normality has worn thin and cracked in places, and there are growing signs of hardship and suffering that can no longer be concealed.</p>\n<p>Food Shortages Now</p>\n<p>There are food shortages now where none existed before. They are still sporadic--no eggs one day, no butter the next. But long queues of shoppers outside grocery stores are now a common sight. Prices have soared too, especially on the black market, where scarcer items can sometimes still be found.</p>\n<p>“Fish,” a cabbie muttered after he was coaxed into sharing some of his grievances with a foreigner. “Now you have to be a rich man to afford to eat fish.”</p>\n<p>One does not walk far down a main street in Baghdad these days without seeing someone who has been wounded or a shop window criss-crossed with tape to prevent it from shattering in the event of an explosion nearby. The national museum has been closed for two years, ostensibly for renovation but in fact because the exhibits have all been moved to basement bomb shelters.</p>\n<p>Where most hotels post fire instructions, those in Baghdad tell guests what to do in case of an air raid. And with fighting raging on the southern front near Basra for almost all this month, black flags are beginning to appear all over town, regulations or no.</p>\n<p>Worst of All, the Missiles</p>\n<p>Then, of course, there are the missiles.</p>\n<p>There were six attacks on Baghdad by Iranian long-range missiles in the last four months of 1986. This year, there were that many attacks in the first three weeks of January. The one on Jan. 22 was the worst. It landed in a residential neighborhood, destroying several homes and killing or wounding about 100 people, according to witnesses and residents of the area.</p>\n<p>“The missiles are like Russian roulette,” one diplomat said. “You never know when they are going to hit.”</p>\n<p>The war has bled Iraq’s oil-based economy dry and continues to cost every penny of the estimated $7 billion to $8 billion that the country earns annually from oil exports of about 1.8 million barrels a day.</p>\n<p>The economic hardship is far worse in Iran, where oil exports have been severely disrupted by Iraqi air attacks on refineries, pumping stations and tankers in recent months. But Iran has been on a war footing since the outbreak of hostilities in September of 1980, whereas Iraq’s attempts to maintain a “guns and butter” economy have exhausted about $35 billion in prewar foreign exchange reserves and run up an estimated $25 billion in debt to Western creditors alone.</p>\n<p>‘Pampered Our People’</p>\n<p>“We have not done enough to adjust our import-export mechanisms to cope with the war situation,” a senior Iraqi official conceded in a recent interview. “We have pampered our people too much.”</p>\n<p>Only last year, after the collapse of oil prices, did the government make a serious attempt to begin cutting back, with the result that ordinary people are now starting to feel the pinch. Electricity, education and medical care are still free, but the hospitals are so full of war casualties that civilians are admitted only in emergency cases.</p>\n<p>Last fall, when the government tried to eliminate free transportation to work for civil servants, many workers protested by staying home until the order was partially rescinded.</p>\n<p>“For 35 years, Iraqis have been used to a steadily rising standard of living,” a Western diplomat said. “While they are still not badly off compared to many other Arabs, for the first time their living standards are falling.”</p>\n<p>Death for Criticism</p>\n<p>Judging public perceptions and attitudes about the war is not easy in a country with a regime as authoritarian as Iraq’s. But diplomats note that the government recently felt obliged to publish a new law making criticism of an Iraqi official punishable by sentences ranging from seven years’ imprisonment to death.</p>\n<p>Security in Baghdad has also been increased in recent months, with concrete planters popping up in front of the main Iraqi airlines office on Saddoun Street and more tanks and troops in evidence around key government buildings.</p>\n<p>“Iraqis still put on a brave face and do their best to adjust,” one diplomat said. “But a certain sullenness that was not here before appears to be settling in.”</p>\n<p>There are still street weddings, but fewer of them. The discos still attract sizeable crowds, but the people come less often and leave earlier than before.</p>\n<p>And over at the Alghazal bowling alley, most of the team slots for the “Iraqi Army Victory Bowling Tournament” have been filled by Filipino hotel workers because the Iraqis don’t come any more.</p>\n<p>At the Space Cadet video parlor on Saddoun Street, a middle-aged man edges up to an American visitor and says: “I am very sorry. These games not as good as the ones in America. The ones in America much better. I have been there. I have seen them. Please, can you help me to get a visa?”</p>\n<p>It is one of the signs that the people of Baghdad are finally realizing that 85 miles from the front is not so far from the war after all.</p> "

    "text": " <p>Peace signs bob up and down like buoys in a sea of tie-dyed shirts and sandals, vying for the eye’s attention with a placard that proclaims “Hemp Heals.”</p>\n<p>From the podium, the speaker is denouncing multinational corporations for exploiting the people and the power structure in Washington for wasting billions of dollars on defense.</p>\n<p>There is only one thing out of place in this college campus scene from the 1960s--the date.</p>\n<p>It is 1992, the place is Ashland, Ore., and the speaker is former California Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., who is <i> still </i> running for President--even if most of the national media has chosen to forget that.</p>\n<p>A long, long time ago in election-year politics--late last March--Jerry Brown’s star was clearly rising. He had just defeated Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, the front-runner in the Democratic race, in the Connecticut primary, his media entourage had ballooned overnight from less than five to more than 50 people and the pledges were beginning to pour into his by now famous 1-800 campaign number.</p>\n<p>Never regarded until then as more than a curious political anachronism, Brown was suddenly a serious contender whose Populist “Take America Back” campaign looked as if it might ignite the same emotion on the left as Republican challenger Patrick J. Buchanan’s “America first” campaign briefly fired on the right.</p>\n<p>But as the race to win the Democratic presidential nomination enters the homestretch, Brown’s quixotic campaign is ending much as it began: in obscurity.</p>\n<p>After a string of humiliating primary defeats--in New York he even finished behind Paul E. Tsongas, who had long since dropped out of the race--the press has turned its attention elsewhere and Brown is back in what he says is “the black hole of media anonymity” in which a “corrupt” money-driven political system conspires to place candidates who don’t play by its rules.</p>\n<p>The press corps traveling with Brown has dropped to two--although local reporters pick him up at campaign stops. Often he has only one aide with him these days. Even longtime friend and adviser Jacques Barzaghi took a few days off.</p>\n<p>Brown refuses to concede defeat, but all but acknowledges that he cannot wrest the Democratic nomination from Clinton. “I can count,” he says. “I know how many delegates he’s got. I understand the system.”</p>\n<p>What, then, makes Jerry run?</p>\n<p>“The cause,” he says simply. “The cause is bigger than any individual candidate. I’m running because I want to carve out an insurgent movement that will keep the tradition and the conscience of the (Democratic) Party before the electorate.”</p>\n<p>The Democrats “are in danger of being taken over by the same interests that control the Republican Party,” adds Brown, who says that Clinton is “as close as you can get to being a Republican while still using the name Democrat.”</p>\n<p>In much the same way as Buchanan is trying to move the Republican Party to the right, Brown, with strikingly similar rhetoric, is trying to move the Democrats to the left to head off what he sees as the party’s “imminent takeover” by corporate interests.</p>\n<p>It’s a tough job, but Brown feels someone has to do it. “Someone has to protest the gong-show mentality of the political campaign process. . . . Someone has to stand for change. . . . Someone has to remind the Democratic Party of its roots.”</p>\n<p>And so, fueled by continued pledges to his toll-free number, Brown’s anti-Establishment, ‘60s-something campaign keeps on trucking from college campus to alternative bookstore, directing its message mostly to activist community groups and students. The Oregon rally was repeated at campuses across the West Coast all last week.</p>\n<p>“The ruling class has lost touch with the American people,” Brown told students at Stanford University. “They have lost touch because they swim in a world of privilege, power and wealth.”</p>\n<p>The rioting in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney G. King verdicts is a “reflection of many years of abandonment and neglect (of inner-city problems) by both parties,” he said before a meeting of community activists in East Palo Alto. “If you vote for Clinton, you are voting for a status quo that will take you nowhere.”</p>\n<p>After the Pennsylvania primary April 28, in which Brown received 26% of the vote, most political experts were predicting that nowhere was also about as far as the former California governor’s campaign would get.</p>\n<p>In the last Los Angeles Times Poll, Brown was leading Clinton among California Democrats, 51% to 37%. But that survey was taken April 23-26; whether Brown’s support will hold up remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>The candidate himself professes to have “no idea” how he will do in Tuesday’s Nebraska and West Virginia primaries, saying only that he has a “feeling” that there is a “hidden constituency” out there waiting to respond to his message.</p>\n<p>His loosely run, low-budget organization takes no polls, but Brown says he can “sense a huge vacuum in the country that will be responsive to the things I’m talking about.”</p>\n<p>Asked why it hasn’t responded yet, Brown stares off into space for a moment. “Look,” he says finally, “it is out there. It is. It’s just being masked by the way the political system works.”</p> "
